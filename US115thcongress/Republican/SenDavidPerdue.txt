We need real consequences for Members of Congress if they don’t get the job done. There is a different way to get results. That's why I’ve been working closely w/ Republicans & Democrats to completely change Washington's budget process. This failure only further exposes the underlying problems w/ Washington’s current budget process. Some Senators are already patting themselves on the back for partially funding the government. In the real world, you are held accountable to complete the job. We had the opportunity to fully fund the government on time for the 1st time in 22 years. Instead of getting it all done, Congress threw in the towel & used a short-term continuing resolution. This is unacceptable. Here we go again. In typical Washington fashion, Congress has once again fallen short of completing its Constitutional responsibility.

If you want meaningful results on trade, you have to have the courage to have serious, tough conversations with other countries, regardless of how many headaches it may cause for some folks in Washington. President Trump is a business guy who spent his career successfully negotiating deals all over the world. For years, he has seen how America has often been treated unfairly when it comes to trade. President Trump’s approach is working, and I’m tired of senators trying to undercut him at every turn.pic.twitter.com/d9GddCnzfi This is a big win for Georgia. #SHEP has the best return on investment of any @USACEHQ project in the country at 7.3 to 1 and will help the U.S. compete globally. @gaports #gapol … Wow.

Hope you’ll tune in. #MakeCongressWorkAgain #gapol It is important to remember that simply canceling the August state work period is not the goal. We should be working nights & weekends now to get the results the American people sent us here to deliver. #MakeCongressWorkAgain We still have 271 nominations to confirm, and we must complete the appropriations process before September 30. @POTUS was clear when he said he will not sign another last-minute omnibus spending bill again. We should not go home until we have completed our work. Senate Republicans have accomplished a great deal this year, but more needs to be done. That’s why it is encouraging that Leader McConnell took our concerns into consideration. Congress should work nights, weekends, & through the August recess if necessary to break through gridlock, confirm @POTUS’ team, & fund the gov’t on time. #MakeCongressWorkAgain Congress has 54 working days until the fiscal year ends. If Washington doesn’t act now, the cycle of last-minute funding bills to keep the lights on will continue, while a few politicians get in a room & decide how to spend a trillion dollars. With the  pick in the 2018 @MLBDraft, the @SFGiants have selected Georgia Tech’s Joey Bart   Joey is the highest #MLBDraft pick in #GaTech history and tied for the highest @GTAthletics pick in a major professional sports draft! #TogetherWeSwarm #ProJacketspic.twitter.com/VekQ9hUOAI Under @POTUS’ leadership:   Nearly 3M new jobs created  870 rules & regs eliminated  1,500 bureaucrats fired @ VA for poor performance  Consumer confidence = 17-year high  CEO confidence = 20-year high   Gorsuch confirmed to Supreme Court  ...and just getting started!

While there’s more to do, we cannot ignore the fact that we are past the tipping point on the debt crisis. Most of our discretionary spending – including funding for defense, veterans, & domestic programs – is borrowed. Our veterans & their families deserve the benefits they were promised. The #VAMissionAct will improve the health care delivery system & make life a little easier for our nation’s heroes. @SenatorIsakson deserves a great deal of credit for his work on this plan.

It’s called the CFPB, and it knows when you swipe your credit card, when you deposit your paycheck, and what your credit score is. It’s about time politicians get serious about balancing the budget w/o any gimmicks. But let’s not kid ourselves. Passing a Balanced Budget Amendment alone will not solve our country’s debt crisis. We won’t solve the debt crisis unless & until we fix our broken budget process. The House will vote this week on a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. This is one of the first things I introduced when I got to Congress. 45 states, including GA, are required to balance their budgets every single year, and Washington needs to do the same.

We will not solve our nation’s $21 trillion debt crisis by simply fixing the budget process, but we won’t solve the debt crisis unless and until we fix the broken budget process. #gapol The larger problem here is Washington's budget process has failed AGAIN. It is imperative the newly formed Joint Select Committee change the budget process to address the structural problems that lead to this unacceptable outcome. This spending bill is not a product that represents everybody. It’s a product written by a few politicians who got in a room and decided how to spend a trillion dollars. The result is a massive spending package projected to increase the federal debt by another trillion dollars. I oppose this massive spending bill. Washington has reached a new low. We are 6 months into this fiscal year and just now voting on funding for the remainder of it. Not to mention, this is after TWO shutdowns and FIVE continuing resolutions. This is beyond pathetic.

This week, the Senate is taking bipartisan action to roll back this overreach and provide relief to regional and community banks around the country.

My full statement:pic.twitter.com/vchNCWgUfB If people really want to solve the DACA situation, secure our border, and fix the flaws in our current system that incentivize illegal immigration, they should be eager to support our plan. As I’ve said before – @POTUS has been very clear about what he will sign into law, and the Secure & Succeed Act is it.pic.twitter.com/vMCzvV5EMr Here's what the Department of Homeland Security has to say about the Schumer-Rounds-Collins proposal:  "SCHUMER-ROUNDS-COLLINS DESTROYS ABILITY OF DHS TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS, CREATING A MASS AMNESTY FOR OVER 10 MILLION ILLEGAL ALIENS, INCLUDING CRIMINALS" "The Administration strongly opposes passage of the Schumer-Rounds-Collins Amendment." Statement from @PressSec regarding the Schumer-Rounds-Collins Amendment:  There’s still ONLY ONE immigration proposal to be voted on that fully secures our borders, codifies Kate’s Law, and adequately equips our border patrol agents. The Grassley proposal is BACKED by DHS, not torn apart by DHS like the Schumer plan. Unbelievable. The Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration plan actually suspends enforcement of illegal immigration until June 2018. This is incredibly misguided and makes our country vulnerable to gangs, traffickers, and terrorists.pic.twitter.com/1bGOUZhGnN Heartbroken over the terrible shooting in Florida.

DACA and funding the federal government are two seperate issues. They have nothing to do with each other and should not be tied together. I'm shocked Democrats are advocating for shutting down the government over this. It is no way to govern. It is absolutely ridiculous that we're in the fourth month of this fiscal year-- in the middle of January-- and we still haven’t funded the government for the balance of the year. No other entity that I know of can do this except the United States federal government.
