Check out this @MaumelleMonitor story on her career & memories of her service.  … Sending special recognition today to those with Down Syndrome, their families and friends. They are loved, cherished, and fearfully & wonderfully made. We recognize just how special they truly are. @ARDownSyndrome #WDSD2018 #WorldDownSyndromeDaypic.twitter.com/EN0UxYFYqZ The Senate just overwhelmingly passed #SESTA to hold accountable those companies that knowingly facilitate the exploitation and trafficking of some of the most vulnerable people in our society. WATCH my floor speech from yesterday where I discussed the bill and my support for it.pic.twitter.com/qAZkJQt6Nq #SBDCDay is an opportunity to highlight the #Arkansas Small Business & Technology Development Center's (@ASBTDC) great work. Helping small businesses & entrepreneurs – which are the backbone of our economy – grow, create jobs and obtain capital benefits our state tremendously.pic.twitter.com/nPLfSKQ0T0 Great to see you all and tell you in person how much we appreciate the work you do. I'm a former school board member, so I know how important #education is. As leaders in your schools, you're on the front lines helping to make sure our students are reaching their full potential. … It's a snowy spring morning here in DC. Thanks to the @uscapitol staff and police for keeping everything running smoothly and helping make sure we're safe. There's a lot on the agenda in the #Senate and we wouldn't be able to do any of it without their work.pic.twitter.com/6BA3lDWRcJ My #Senate Broadband Caucus co-chairs & I hosted an event to discuss expanding #broadband access, esp. since technology is becoming so integral to the way we educate students in the 21st century. Closing the digital divide will help kids in rural areas learn at school & at home.pic.twitter.com/n6w68SEFQs Should #SESTA pass, and I believe it will, these bad actors won’t be able to fade quietly into the dark. We're going to give state attorneys general the authority to prosecute websites that violate federal sex trafficking laws. That’s why I support this bill. It’s time to rip the cover away from these bad actors. We are going to do that by making narrowly-crafted changes to the law to ensure websites that knowingly facilitate criminal sex trafficking online are held accountable. #SESTA will help by giving law enforcement and prosecutors additional tools to crack down on human trafficking. It will help us take on nefarious actors like Backpage, who hid behind the Communications Decency Act to avoid prosecution for trafficking crimes. Fortunately, our state is fighting back. Last year Arkansas legislators approved a law requiring state-licensed truckers to be trained in spotting the red flags of human trafficking. Since Polaris began operating over ten years ago, its helplines have received reports of 203 cases of human trafficking from my home state of Arkansas.   Almost half of those were in the past two years. About to go on the #Senate floor to discuss a bill we're debating this week to combat #HumanTrafficking. Smuggling people for forced labor & sex slavery is a heinous crime. Websites that knowingly facilitate it must be held accountable. #SESTA  Watch here:  … One way to mark #NationalAgDay is to help current & aspiring farmers – including veterans – get the tools, technology & resources needed to succeed.

They are a vital resource and I support the work they do.pic.twitter.com/bsUsPLA0eq Community banks & credit unions have been unfairly penalized by regulations targeting Wall Street. Eliminating the one-size-fits-all rules for smaller institutions will help free up resources & make it easier to provide capital to small biz so they can invest & hire more workers. We need a regulatory system where small, medium and large financial institutions can succeed. Under Dodd-Frank, we have a system where some financial institutions are too big to fail and others are too small to succeed. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act will provide much-needed regulatory relief to small banking institutions. I know how important LIHEAP is to #Arkansas. … Bailey Alexander, an intern in our Little Rock office, is visiting #Washington with fellow students from @Ouachita.

It'll empower states to invest in, upgrade & improve our nation's crumbling #water systems.  pic.twitter.com/igmtfSBdzc Great news: As a result of @RepDavidRouzer, @MarkWarner & my 'Combat-Injured #Veterans Tax Fairness Act' – now law – 133k #vets may qualify for a refund of federal taxes paid in error on disability severance pay.

I thought the president delivered a positive message & I’m ready to get to work with anyone who is ready to find solutions.pic.twitter.com/huaj7FEVQq The #SOTU address was a call to work together. @POTUS' speech was a positive, optimistic message to all Americans. It laid out an opportunity to work together on many pressing issues facing our country. Read my statement: … Honored to have Col. Jennifer Wesley of the US Army as my guest for #SOTU tonight. She’s from Camden #AR and graduated from @uapbinfo  Proud of her service to our countrypic.twitter.com/9gR02jrW96 Enjoyed visiting with some Arkansans in DC today: @BOMAIntl Greater Little Rock group in town for their Winter Business Meeting & National Issues Conference, and Kathey Haynie of Arkansas @schoolnurses.pic.twitter.com/YabUCcKpnb Not only will the SRF WIN Act help provide Americans w/ basic water infrastructure, it will also create jobs, keep commodity & utility prices low, and help us remain competitive globally. I urge my colleagues to support it. #WaterInfrastructureNow  SRF WIN Act is a critical component to future water infrastructure financing. It will make the process easier and more affordable for states and communities to access federal water infrastructure funding. Now is the time to act & make water infrastructure investment a priority. .@SenBooker & I will soon introduce the "Securing Required Funding for Water Infrastructure Now (SRF WIN) Act" to revolutionize the way we invest in needed water infrastructure. It will help communities across the nation with drinking and wastewater projects. We can, and must, work together to provide all Americans safe and reliable #drinkingwater and effective #wastewater and #stormwater treatment. Access to safe & clean water is critical to the livelihood of every American. In #waterinfrastructure funding alone, the US faces an over $500B shortfall, which includes drinking water, wastewater, stormwater and water supply projects. This is a national emergency, and one where we can find bipartisan support to address. It's clear that infrastructure investment boosts our economy, creates immediate jobs and produces decades of economic opportunity. Our reliance on a fix-as-fail approach is more expensive & poses a risk to public safety. During the #SOTU @POTUS will discuss the importance of #infrastructure investment. Our nation's infrastructure is in need of an overhaul. We need to revamp the way we prioritize & fund our nation's infrastructure. I'm speaking on the #Senate floor about upgrading our nation's #infrastructure. Watch here:  … Recently, I was honored to present Mr. E.L. Heffley, a Korean War #veteran, with the Medal of Gratitude on behalf of the Korean government. @KARK4News covered the event and spoke with Mr. Heffley about his experience.

Preston, who has been placing flags & flowers on the graves of vets since 2015, will attend the #SOTU and be recognized for his outstanding efforts. We all can & should follow his lead. … Unborn children can feel pain as early as 20 wks. Only the US & six other nations – China & North Korea among them – allow elective abortions past 20 wks.

We must aim to use the power of our offices for good. Supporting children's healthcare and passing this continuing resolution is a component of that goal. I continue to be frustrated by the new normal of continuing resolutions & stop-gap measures to fund the government. The idea of willingly facilitating a government shut-down is reckless. Unfortunately, it appears that some of my colleagues prefer stalemate over robust debate. We must work to ensure these families need not worry every few years, or as of now, months, regarding continued access to benefits for the health and wellbeing of their children. We must commit to passing this extension to provide these families peace of mind and stability. It's time we provide #CHIP w/ the necessary funding. I know #Arkansas families relying on it to provide medical care for their children are pleased the legislation before this chamber includes a 6-yr CHIP reauthorization, the longest extension since its inception. I rise today to express my support and to highlight the importance of reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). This program helps care for our nation's neediest children. Heading to the #SenateFloor to talk about reauthorizing #CHIP and the continuing resolution. WATCH live here:  … .@SecretarySonny is in #Arkansas to hear from some of our state's farmers.

Improving the tax code is a WIN for businesses, employees & consumers.

READ about how via @harrisondaily ->   "We must realize the time is always right to do right." -#MartinLutherKingJr   Dr. King's life, words & actions inspired a nation to do what is right.

Watch this video for the full speech.pic.twitter.com/tUybHSpIkS I’m proud of our efforts to help improve veterans’ health care, benefits, and accountability at the VA. We passed 10 bills in 2017, providing @DeptVetAffairs with the right tools to see to it that veterans have the services they need.pic.twitter.com/TCc2bTSgPb I am proud of our efforts to pass this landmark #taxreform law and am confident that it will have lasting, positive effects on our economy. That's why we took great care to ensure that the agr industry would see the benefits of tax reform. Establishing a tax code that works for our farmers and ranchers, as opposed to against them, is vital to their ability to plan for the future and invigorate rural economies. My colleagues and I on the #Ag Committee under the steadfast leadership of @SenPatRoberts are working hard to reauthorize the #FarmBill. Programs authorized by the Farm Bill are absolutely vital to farmers, ranchers and consumers & will provide more certainty in rural America. Uncertainty is devastating to our economy. There are few industries that are inherently more affected by uncertainty than #agriculture. We've taken steps to eliminate some of the punitive, needless #regulations that create uncertainty for our #farmers and #ranchers. Finally #farmers & #ranchers will be able to expense 100% of their capital investments, such as equipment, over the next 4 years. In his address to @FarmBureau earlier this week @POTUS called that the “sleeper” in the bill. He’s right. It will be good for family-run ag operations 97% of the farms in #Arkansas are family owned, and the vast majority of them will now be exempt from the estate tax. This is a big deal. It will help keep those #farms and #ranches in the family for generations to come. >94% of #farms are organized as pass-through businesses, meaning they're impacted by the same #tax provisions as individuals. Lower tax rates across the board and a 20% deduction on their taxable income means immediate savings, which can be reinvested to help grow the operation. #Agriculture is Arkansas's largest industry, adding around $16B to our economy annually & accounting for nearly 1 in 6 jobs. We're in the nation’s top 10 producers of a number of #ag commodities. #TaxReform helps create an economic environment where the ag industry can thrive. About to speak on the #Senate floor with some of my @SenateAgGOP colleagues to highlight the positive impacts our historic #taxreform law will have on the #agricultural industry.
