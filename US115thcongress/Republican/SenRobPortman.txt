Looking forward to expanding opportunities for Made in #Ohio cars to cross the Pacific. #Jobs Making progress to bolster cybersecurity at @DHSgov today with the #Senate Homeland Security & Government Affairs cmte approving my bipartisan DHS Cyber Incident Response Team Act   Today at @GOPSenateFinance hearing I spoke w/ leaders in the auto industry about how misuse of Section 232 could negatively impact the auto industry & #jobs. I’ve introduced the bipartisan Trade Security Act to reform 232 so its used as originally intended   This morning, along with several of my colleagues, I introduced the bipartisan Artificial Intelligence in Government Act which will ensure the govt understands the benefits & pitfalls of AI.   Today the #Senate Foreign Relations Cmte passed my bipartisan resolution marking the 85th anniversary of the #Holodomor. We must never forget the atrocities committed against the #Ukrainian people at the hands of the Soviet Union.   I had the pleasure of meeting this morning with #Ohio mineworkers to discuss the status of the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans. I’m a cosponsor of the Miners’ Pension Protection Act & will continue to fight to protect Miners’ pensions.pic.twitter.com/lK5Ei8tDSg I’m glad the House-Senate #opioidpackage included my bipartisan proposal to lift the #IMD exclusion. This is extremely important to expand access to addiction treatment to those who truly need it.   #Ohio Congratulations to @Maryhaven and Shawn Holt as they celebrate 65 years of helping people restore their lives. I’ve seen firsthand the incredible work they do and will continue to be supportive of their efforts as we work together to turn the tide of addiction.pic.twitter.com/kmSosEUurr We must help more people get long-term treatment & recovery they need to overcome addictions, & stop the influx of deadly synthetic drugs from entering our communities. The final #House & Senate #opiodpackage does just that!   #STOPAct #CARA2 #CRIBAct #IMD I applaud the #House & #Senate for coming together on a final #opioidpackage that includes my bipartisan #STOPAct, Improving Care Act to lift the #IMD exclusion, #CRIBAct & a number of my initiatives for #CARA2. A big step in combating the #opioidcrisis   Christmas in September in Colerain Township. What a truly inspiring story about the strength of this #Ohio community. Jane and my prayers are with little Brody and his family. … I met w/ GM CEO today and asked her to make a public commitment to reinvesting in the #Lordstown plant. I’m disappointed she did not.  #Ohio remains a leader in the auto industry & I will continue to do everything I can to ensure it remains that way.   I remain disappointed in the GM cutbacks at the #Lordstown plant. Today, I had a frank discussion w/ GM’s CEO Mary Barra & pressed her to make a public commitment to the Lordstown plant. I’m disappointed she did not do so but will continue to fight for this community.pic.twitter.com/lPNH42IcJm The #IMD Exclusion limits treatment options for those impacted by the #opioidcrisis. Congress should lift the limit on inpatient stays for individuals with substance use disorder & I’m working to ensure it’s in the final House-Senate opioid package. Good news on #SESTA. DC court dismissed case challenging new anti-trafficking law. My bipartisan measure was carefully crafted to target online sex trafficking & it’s already making a difference. #Ohio Good news for #ButlerCo in the ongoing efforts to combat the #opioidepidemic across #Ohio … The #GreatLakes are an invaluable resource to #Ohio & I have long backed the #GreatLakes Resortation Initiative. A new study released today by the #GreatLakes Commission shows the positive economic impact the #GLRI is having on #Ohio.    I have long championed the #GreatLakes Restoration Initiative. A new study released today shows that #GLRI is improving economic growth & the quality in life for coastal residents. Great news for #Ohio!   Congrats to @realDonaldTrump for signing the updated #KORUS. I look forward to seeing more Made in the U.S. cars being shipped to South Korea! I continue to push for the lifting of the #IMD Exclusion which currently limits access to addiction treatment & prevents many Americans from getting the help they need. We must continue to expand access to treatment for those who really need it. #Ohio As the #opioidcrisis rages on people need treatment. However, an old policy prohibits states from using Medicaid $$ to pay for treatment at facilities w/ >16 beds. I’ve introduced a bipartisan bill to change this so patients can get the treatment they need   Good read from @LimaYNN about my bipartisan #STOPAct that passed the #Senate last week. It will be signed into law this year & not a moment too soon. We have to get these dangerous synthetic drugs out of our communities ASAP. … The #drugepidemic is devastating SW #Ohio families & communities. I’m glad that #ButlerCo was designated as a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area so they are able to receive additional federal resources to strengthen efforts to combat the drug crisis.   Today #ButlerCo received a federal designation as a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. I fought for this, and it’s good news for #ButlerCo because it will provide them w/ additional resources to help combat the drug trafficking in the region.   Excited for Northrop Grumman’s 35,000 sq. ft. expansion. This will bring more #jobs to the #Dayton region as they continue to manufacture systems that keep our country safe. #Ohio … I appreciate @POTUS signing into law legislation that provides a new automated range at #CampRavenna so our men & women training for the #Ohio National Guard have the best training, equipment & facilities to prepare them for defending the US.   #LakeErie not only provides drinking water for thousands of #Ohioans, it’s also provides countless #jobs. Good news that #GLRI passed this week to help us keep #LakeErie clean.   #Ohio #WhoDey thinks they’re going to beat the @Bengals? I’ll take AJ Green and the undefeated Bengals over Panthers any day! Go #Cincinnati! One of the most dangerous aspects of #opioidaddiction is how quickly a person can become addicted. That’s why I’ve urged #Senate leadership to include my bipartisan #CARA2 initiatives, which include sensible RX limits for acute pain patients, in the final opioids package I had a productive meeting w/ #MontgomeryCo officials earlier this week to discuss how they are using their funding through my #CARA law to combat the #opioidcrisis. Their incredible work will go a long way to help individuals overcome addiction.   #Ohio Hundreds of bird species migrate through #Ohio each year, making it one of the top destinations for birding. I’m glad the Senate EPW cmte passed my bipartisan Migratory Birds of the Americas Conservation Act, which helps protect migratory birds.   For too long, foreign countries have been able to ship deadly synthetic drugs like fentanyl thru our own US mail with relative ease. No more. My bipartisan #STOPAct has passed the Senate & will soon be signed into law so that we can help stop this poison.   I have traveled across #Ohio to visit w/ 20+ businesses, including Lima Pallet that have reinvested in their companies & their workers, including higher wages, bonuses, new plants & equipment & more retirement benefits thank to #taxreform! #ItWorks I applaud @POTUS for signing legislation this week that ensures NASIC on @WrightPatt has the resources to fulfill its important intelligence analysis mission for our Air Force & national policymakers.   #Ohio Ready to cheer on the @OhioState against Tulane this afternoon! Give them a reason to ring that Victory Bell loud & proud, #Buckeyes! The IMD exclusion limits access to treatment & prevents many Americans from getting the help they need for substance addiction. This week I introduced a bill that will fix this problem and allow more to get the help they need.   My bipartisan #STOPAct will soon be signed into law. Across the nation, leaders have voiced their support of this bill which will help to rid our communities of dangerous illegal synthetic drugs like fentanyl.   #Ohio My Educating Tomorrow’s Workforce Act, which was signed into law recently, will help prepare students for today’s #jobs by strengthening #CTE programs & promoting partnerships w/ local biz & community stakeholders.   PSA: Tomorrow is National Public Lands Day which means entrance to all #NationalParks is free. I hope #Ohioans take advantage of the beautiful weather and visit one of our eight #NationalParks. @CVNPNPS is one of my favorites! #Ohio Congrats to Alex Herrgott, the newly-named Executive Director of the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council!  I look forward to working with him & team to cut #redtape, rebuild our infrastructure & create good #jobs! The cleanup & redevelopment of Piketon is critical for jobs, economic development & the future of Southern #Ohio. I’m pleased @POTUS is signing legislation today to ensure we have sufficient resources for cleanup work @ Portsmouth Gasesous Diffusion Plant   The mission at @WrightPatt is critically important & I’m proud that @POTUS is signing into law today legislation that will help expedite important facility upgrades so #NASIC can continue its important work.   A new, automated multi-purpose machine gun range will give the #Ohio National Guard an important & much needed training capability. I applaud @POTUS for signing into law today this legislation that will support #CampRavenna’s important mission   Pleased that later today @POTUS will sign into law legislation that funds several of my #Ohio priorities, including funding for:  #CARA programs to combat #opioidabuse #Ohio’s defense installations   #LakeErie & cleanup #Piketon.     BROWNS WIN!!!!!!!!pic.twitter.com/zCu79nBJhj Interested in joining my D.C. office as an intern?

It’s critical for safeguarding these kids & upholding our immigration system   The #Senate passed the #STOPAct this week, which I authored with @SenAmyKlobuchar.  This bipartisan bill will help combat the #opioidcrisis & give more Americans who are gripped by addiction the chance to live up to their God-given potential.   I spoke on @Senatefloor this week & discussed my bipartisan #STOPAct. The #Senate passed the bill w/an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote & not a moment too soon. With 72000 lives lost last year from the #opioidcrisis I’m working to get it signed into law asap   The Responsibility for Unaccomapanied Minors Act that I introduced today will help to both ensure these children’s safety and make sure they show up for their immigration court hearings.   Based on new data from the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations, which I chair, HHS is struggling to keep track of unaccompanied minors. That’s why I introduced legislation today that will require HHS to keep better track of & care of these children.   My bipartisan #STOPAct passed the #Senate last night & I’m working to get it to the president’s desk as quickly as possible. It has already garnered praise from leaders across #Ohio. Here’s what they’re saying about the #STOPAct:  … For all those observing #YomKippur in #Ohio & around the country starting at sundown, Jane and I wish you a meaningful fast with friends, family, and community.

I’m pleased the #Senate EPW cmte passed my bipartisan Migratory Birds of the Americas Conservation Act today to protect bird population so they may be enjoyed for generations to come   In the final House-Senate opioid package I will push for inclusion of my new bipartisan bill to lift the #IMD exclusion. It’s incredibly important to expanding access to treatment & an important step in combating the #opioidcrisis.   I’m working to lift the #IMD exclusion, an arcane federal policy that prevents many Ohioans from getting the treatment they need. I introduced new bipartisan legislation today to resolve this issue &help those struggling w/ addiction get the care they need   At the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations I led an 18-month investigation which found that a majority of packages entering the US thru the Postal Service had little or no screening. The Senate passed my #STOPAct yesterday to fix this &combat #opioidcrisis   I believe we will get my #STOPAct signed into law before the end of the year. Senate passed it yesterday & House passed it in June both w/ overwhelming bipartisan support. Critically important to our efforts to combat #opioidcrisis in #Ohio & around the US   I’ve been working to get the #STOPAct passed for 2 years now & I’m proud that the Senate passed it yesterday. This bipartisan bill will help stop the influx of #fentanyl from being shipped into our communities through the Postal Service   #Ohio #opioidcrisis The opioids package the #Senate passed 99 to 1 tonight includes my bipartisan #STOPAct. This legislation is designed to help turn the tide on the #opioidepidemic and also includes a number of my other key priorities like the #CRIBAct and aspects of #CARA2   Tonight the Senate passed my bipartisan #STOPAct with a vote of 99 to 1. Passing the #STOPAct is a victory in our efforts to combat the newest & deadliest aspect of the #opioidcrisis: the overwhelming supply of cheap, deadly synthetic drugs like fentanyl.    For 231 years our Constitution has served as the foundation of our great Nation. It’s not always easy these days, but we must never forget our mission as a country is “to form a more perfect union.” Happy #ConstitutionDay With a strong economy more workers are needed in the US! However, the #opioidcrisis has taken many able-bodied men&women out of the workforce. I'll continue to work on common-sense solutions to help these individuals back into the workforce   #STOPAct #CARA2 In a poll I conducted last week, out of 820 people asked 71% have been affected or know someone who has been affected by the #opioidcrisis. Thankfully, the #Senate is voting on my bipartisan #STOPAct tonight so that we can help our law enforcement combat this epidemic.pic.twitter.com/qiCpgc8r9L Important day as the #Senate is slated to pass my bipartisan #STOPAct this evening.

I’m pleased the Senate passed legislation earlier this week that ensures sufficient resources to clean the gaseous diffusion plant.   Tomorrow, the #Senate will vote on an opioid package that includes my bipartisan #STOPAct. I’m proud of this legislation that will help combat the #opioidcrisis by keeping this poison from reaching our communities through the mail system. I strongly support programs that allow students to get college credit while in high school. This provides more options for continued education to low-income students & I wrote a letter to @usedgov urging them to expand Pell Dual Enrollment programs.   The #IRS works for the American taxpayer, but in recent years they have become unreliable & unaccountable. It’s time to reform the IRS, and my Protecting American Taxpayers Act aims to do just that.    The @DHSgov networks & systems are vital to the security of #Ohioans & all Americans but they face constant cyber attacks. I’m pleased the House has moved my bipartisan Hack DHS bill one step closer to the president’s desk.   #Ohioans in SE can head to the #VintonCo Air show for free admission TO #Ohio’s largest airshow and delicious BBQ! More information here: … Good luck to the @OhioState #Buckeyes as they take on the masters of advertising, the Horned Frogs of @TCU. … I was disappointed with GM’s decision to cut another shift at the #Lordstown plant & am grateful to the @USDOL for responding favorably to my request to approve a $1.75 million grant to provide employment & training services to workers affected by layoffs at the plant. The new tax law has an incentive to spur investment in low-income areas that truly need it. These are called Opportunity Zones & there are 320 in #Ohio alone. As the programs begin to work, it will help the resurgence of struggling communities. … Yesterday I visited the William Howard Taft National Historic Site and participated in the first annual Taft Day.

It showcased the terrific efforts of the Collaborative to end human trafficking and to help survivors. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act would re-allocate federal funds to our National sites, including the William Howard Taft National Historic site. These funds would help our #NationalParks & other historic sites fix long-delayed maintenance needs.

Today the House version of my Restore Our Parks Act was passed by House @NatResources. This bill will create a dedicated funding source to address the billions in long-delayed maintenance projects at our #NationalParks. Good read from @NRO on my proposal to end government shutdowns for good.  After all, they don’t accomplish anything, don’t get our fiscal house in order, & they disrupt critical government programs that have a big impact on people’s lives: … The Opportunity Zone aspect of #TaxReform will spur investment in low-income areas that truly need it, creating new industry, infrastructure, & #jobs for cities & towns across Ohio.

We must more aggressively combat the #opioidcrisis in America!   Millions of people enjoy our #NationalParks every year but wear & tear has resulted in a long-term backlog of maintenance costing billions. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will allocate already existing funding to our parks so generations to come can enjoy their majesty. Ready to watch the #4 @OhioState take on the Scarlet Knights today at 3:30. O-H! I-O! Let’s go #Buckeyes. Our economy continues to add more #jobs & increase wages thanks in part to #taxreform.

By working together, we can combat this so they can achieve their God-given potential.   As we continue into the 21st century, businesses rely heavily on internet access to meet with demand. That’s why I introduced a bipartisan bill to increase broadband access in rural areas so that rural businesses don’t have to suffer simply due to location   This discussion over releasing cmte confidential docs poses serious questions for Democrats.

The Columbus Zoo simply wouldn’t be the same without Jack Hanna’s efforts & leadership.  …' The Opportunity Zones provision in the #TaxReform law will help revitalize low-income neighborhoods, rebuild our infrastructure & create more #jobs. #Ohio designated 320 lowincome areas as Opportunity Zones & I'm excited for the future of these communities   This month is National Alcohol & Drug Addiction Recovery Month. Received good news yesterday that the #Senate will vote on my bipartisan #STOPAct next week. This bill will help keep fentanyl out of our communities.   I have made combatting the #opioidcrisis one of my top priorities in the #Senate & successfully fought for funding for evidence-based programs to fight addiction. Check out how that funding is helping in #Ohio.   The @ABAesq has given Judge #Kavanaugh their highest possible rating, and for good reason! He is eminently qualified to serve on #SCOTUS & his nomination has my full support. … Good news today with solid #jobs report & strong wage growth. But we must do more to help Americans who’ve remained out of the workforce, including aggressively combating the opioid epidemic.   Last night I spoke on the @SenateFloor urging the #Senate to pass my bipartisan #STOPAct. A few hours later, Senate leadership announced that the bill will be voted on next week & I hope my colleagues vote in a strong bipartisan manner … On the @SenateFloor I highlighted my strong support for Judge #Kavanaugh in reference to claims of insufficient records.

More to do to help Ohioans get the skills they need & combat opioids to ensure all have the opportunity to fulfill their God-given potential. I hope everyone has a fun & safe #LaborDay with their families and friends! Our #NationalParks are an American treasure that must be protected. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will finally tackle the backlog of long-term maintenance projects so that America can preserve our parks for generations to come. … In a recent conversation I had with Sam from Shelby County #Ohio, he told me that his son had passed away from #opioid overdose due to Fentanyl. Unfortunately these stories are far too common. We must pass my #STOP Act & stop this deadly influx. Section 232 of the Trade Act is a vital tool when we have a national security threat but it is being misused. The @WSJ editorial board supports my bipartisan Trade Security Act which will ensure this tool is reserved for genuine national security threats   The Global Engagement Center is charged w/ leading the US government’s efforts to counter foreign propaganda & disinformation from #Russia & other countries. I introduced a bipartisan measure that will allocate $40 million to the @StateDept for the GEC.   The time is now for #IRS reform to make the agency more responsive & accountable to American families. In a joint @CNBC op-ed I wrote w/ former Senator Bob Kerrey it highlights how my bipartisan Protecting Taxpayers Act will reform the #IRS.   Many small business owners in rural communities lack the broadband connection needed to effectively compete in the 2st century. My bipartisan bill will expand internet access in rural communities to promote economic growth & more #jobs.   Judge #Kavanaugh will testify before the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. I have the pleasure of introducing my friend to the committee. A man of humility and outstanding character, I have no doubt he will serve us well if confirmed to #SCOTUS.   Today Senator John McCain will be laid to rest in Annapolis, Maryland. A true American hero and patriot, who will be greatly missed. … According to recent data from @CDCgov, overdose deaths are at an all-time high & by far the 1# drug causing these overdoses is fentanyl. We must end to this illegal influx into our communities. It’s time for the #Senate to pass my bipartisan #STOPAct … .@MissingKids is on the frontlines protecting trafficked children in our country. They bring expertise & resources to local communities across the US. I’m proud to support legislation to reauthorize their funding so they can continue this important work.   Every day across America thousands of infants are born to mothers addicted to #opioids. I’ve worked hard to combat the #opioidcrisis & help these vulnerable babies so they can fulfill their God-given potential.    I’m proud to have received wide support for my bipartisan Trade Security Act which will reform the Section 232 trade law & increase congressional oversight so it is not misused which harms Ohio #jobs & the economy.   In ’97 I authored legislation called the Drug-Free Communities Act which supports evidence-based & community driven drug prevention programs. Needed now more than ever. 25 programs in #Ohio just received new funding to combat the opioid crisis.   I was honored to be asked to introduce Judge #Kavanaugh at his Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Tuesday. I look forward to having a chance to talk about him as a person and explain why I believe he would be a great #SCOTUS Justice.    Jane and I were honored to attend the memorial services for Senator John McCain this morning. It was a moving tribute to a great patriot. Our prayers continue to be with Cindy & the McCain family. Today we say farewell to Senator John McCain at the National Cathedral. He was truly one of a kind and his service and sacrifices he made for his country will never be forgotten. … College football is finally back! Good luck to the #Buckeyes as they take on the Oregon State Beavers at 12 PM! #GoBucks Nothing could be more important than raising awareness for this deadly #opioidepidemic that faces our state and nation on International #OverdoseAwarenessDay.

Now is the time for the Senate to pass the #STOPAct The @WSJ editorial board has endorsed my bipartisan Trade Security Act and business groups have praised the bill, viewing it as a common-sense solution to preserve the important Section 232 tool and ensure it’s used for genuine national security threats.   Enjoying an Italian sausage from @DiRissossasuage a great local, family-owned Mahoning Valley staple.pic.twitter.com/Grx3Lq0yFP It was great meeting with Hope Village Recovery Center leadership, MHRB members, & community leaders today to discuss how the #opioidepidemic is impacting the community of Rootstown #Ohiopic.twitter.com/SKodOmn4D9 Interesting article from @MarketWatch and data from @DeutscheBank on the impact opioids have on our available workforce. My op-ed in the @washingtonpost on how we can combat this epidemic and get more Americans back to work:  pic.twitter.com/tCp8xr3xqo Sadly, fentanyl has become the number one killer of the opioid epidemic in #Ohio. We must do more to keep it out of our communities & that’s why I’m pushing the #Senate to pass my bipartisan #STOPAct legislation. More info in this @Enquirer op-ed:  … So glad staff and first responders were on the scene quickly at the Ross Correctional Institution in #Chillicothe yesterday to save lives. This incident highlights the dangers posed by fentanyl in our communities.  … #Ohio Businesses in rural communities shouldn’t have to struggle because of lack of broadband access. That’s why I introduced a bipartisan bill to help expand internet access in rural communities so they can continue to compete worldwide.   #jobs Hardworking taxpayers shouldn’t have to struggle to get answers from the #IRS, which is currently not the case. That’s why I introduced the Taxpayer Protection Act to reform the #IRS & make it more responsive & accountable to taxpayers. … The Drug-Free Communities Act, which I authored in ’97 when I was in the House, provides matching federal grants for programs aimed at drug prevention. @DaytonDailyNews details the 25 #Ohio organizations that will receive grants to combat the #opioidcrisis … I’m pleased the administration has taken a leading role in combating the #opioidcrisis & the announcement today that 25 #Ohio anti-drug coalitions will receive Drug-Free Communities Act grants is great news! We must continue the fight to end this epidemic.   I founded the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater #Cincinnati, now @PrevFIRST, as a comprehensive effort to reduce youth substance abuse & have seen firsthand that it is a powerful tool to counteract drug use. These 25 grants will make a difference in #Ohio.   Today @POTUS announced that 25 anti-drug coalitions in #Ohio will receive Drug-Free Communities Act grant funding. I authored this law in 1997 to help reduce substance abuse among our youth in our communities & it is making a difference   The @WSJ editorial board endorsed my bipartisan Trade Security Act which is a common-sense solution to preserving Section 232 of the Trade Act while allowing for increased congressional oversight on how it is applied.   It’s vital that we work to ensure that rural communities in #Ohio & across the US have the resources & tech needed for economic development & #job growth. That’s why I introduced legislation w/ @SenCortezMasto to expand internet access in rural communities   On Friday, @SenJohnMcCain will lie in state in the US Capitol, draped in the American flag he spent his life serving. He was a hero in the flesh, right here in this century, and I feel blessed for having known him. … I have the honor of introducing Judge #Kavanaugh at his Judicial Committee #SCOTUS confirmation hearing next week. I look forward to hearing his testimony & having my colleagues & the American people get to know the great man I know him to be.   Exciting news from @CommerceGov today. The US economy grew by 4.2% in the second quarter of this year, the strongest growth since 2014!#Taxreform is working to create #jobs & grow the economy. #Ohio … On @FoxNews this afternoon w/ Neil #Cavuto I discussed my support for updating #NAFTA & trade progress w/ Mexico. I also highlighted my bipartisan Trade Security Act which will reform the tariff process under Section 232 & increase congressional oversight.   When I was elected to the Senate, Senator McCain would jokingly introduce me to reporters as “the jerk who played Obama.” I was proud to honor my friend & colleague on the @SenateFloor this afternoon. Here is my full tribute: … During @SenJohnMcCain '08 presidential campaign, I served as a stand in for then-Senator Obama in debate prep. It was my job help him prepare & get under his skin, and I did. Needless to say, he wasn’t happy with me during those debate sessions. … A @Navy Captain, Congressman, & U.S. Senator, @SenJohnMcCain was first and foremost a patriot. Throughout his whole life—and very prolific life—he lived the motto of his 2008 presidential campaign, which was simply, ‘Country first.’ … It will be a privilege & an honor to introduce Judge #Kavanaugh during his Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing for #SCOTUS next Tuesday. I strongly support his nomination & look forward to seeing him confirmed to the Supreme Court in the coming weeks.   Last week I introduced a bipartisan amendment that would transfer $40 million to the @StateDept, as authorized by law, for the Global Engagement Center to help fight foreign disinformation & propaganda from #Russia & others.  … Too often, the #IRS is unresponsive to the needs of American taxpayers. In an @CNBC op-ed I co-wrote w/ former Senator Bob Kerrey, we discuss my bipartisan Protecting Taxpayers Act to help reform the #IRS.  … More good news thanks to #taxreform: “Consumer confidence in the United States soared in August to an 18-year high and hit seldom-reached peaks, reflecting surging growth in the economy and the lowest unemployment rate in almost two decades”  … #jobs Pleased to see such strong support for my bipartisan Trade Security Act from national & #Ohio business groups.  We must hold countries that violate our trade laws accountable but do so in a way that protects US #jobs.    Insightful read from @NorthForkPatch about the deadly grip fentanyl has on our country & the shocking ease it can be acquired. My bipartisan #STOPAct will give law enforcement the tools they need in order to keep this killer drug out of our communities … Judge #Kavanaugh is an exceptionally gifted legal scholar & most importantly, a good man. I spoke on the @SenateFloor last week about my full support for his nomination to #SCOTUS … Protecting the #GreatLakes should be a nonpartisan issue.

As I’ve said many times, I believe we must do more to open markets to US products, vigorously enforce our trade laws & protect American #jobs. #FEMA plans to award more than $200K in grants for police and fire departments in the #Cincinnati area. I’m proud to have brought these projects to #FEMA’s attention & look forward to our first responders benefiting from this funding.    20 years ago the American people had lost faith in the #IRS & sweeping changes were needed to get the agency back on track. In my @CNBC op-ed, I lay out why it’s time to reform the #IRS once again.   In an op-ed for @CNBC that I co-wrote w/ former Senator Bob Kerrey we discuss why the time is now for #IRS reform in order to help make the agency more responsive & accountable to taxpayers.   The dog days of summer might be behind us, but don’t tell these guys that.

I introduced legislation that will provide the GEC w/ the resources needed.   Last week I chaired a Permanent Subcmte on Investigations hearing to continue congressional oversight over federal agencies to improve their care of unaccompanied minors. As noted in the @AkronBeacon, there is no place for lost children   I spoke on the @SenateFloor last week & urged my #Senate colleagues to meet w/ Judge #Kavanaugh and get to know the compassionate & big hearted person that I know.

As I stated on the #SenateFloor, I fully support his nomination to #SCOTUS … The #opioidepidemic is a devastating scourge on our country. One of its most devastating victims are the infants who are born dependent on drugs & suffer thru withdrawals. I’ve worked to help these kids & ensure they can live out their God-given potential   I wish the brave people of #Ukraine a joyous national day. This is an important day to commemorate the proud history of the Ukrainian people.   #ukraineIndependenceDay The #GreatLakes provide drinking water & #jobs for thousands of #Ohioans.

Fascinating article from @usatoday about this important museum. … .@SenJohnMcCain is a good friend and a great colleague. Jane’s and my prayers are with John, Cindy and his entire family.

I’m proud to support a bill to reauthorize funding so the they can continue their important work   The @OHdeptofhealth estimates that about 84 infants are treated for drug withdrawal in #Ohio hospitals every day. I’ve worked tirelessly to protect our country’s most vulnerable victims of the #opioidcrisis & will continue to do so.   Last night I spoke on the @SenateFloor about my support for #SCOTUS nominee Judge #Kavanaugh. He’s a thought leader among his peers & he understands the proper role of the court is not the legislate from the bench. I’m proud to support his nomination … Last week I toured the Perry’s Victory & International Peace Memorial in #Ohio where they need some significant repairs & maintenance.

I fought hard in the #Senate to add this funding so that we could start to turn the tide on this epidemic.    As co-chair for the Senate #GreatLakes Task Force & I’ve led multiple efforts to protect #LakeErie which provides drinking water for millions of #Ohioans. Here’s a brief summary of the actions I’ve taken to preserve & protect our #GreatLakes   I have known Judge #Kavanaugh for 15+ years & I can attest to his compassion, humility, & big heart.  I urge my colleagues on both side of the aisle to support his nomination for #SCOTUS. Jane and I enjoyed attending the annual @SportsmensAll Save Our Heritage Rally tonight.  Great finish to the day after my Lake Erie fishing trip and roundtable earlier today.pic.twitter.com/rxq4eTFpGf This year, $26 million in federal funding to fight the #opioidepidemic was distributed in #Ohio thanks to the #CURES law. This is great news for #Ohio and I fought hard to get this #opioid funding included in the original #CURES law.   Judge #Kavanaugh has an impressive record and qualifications. Most importantly, he’s a man of great character & I look forward to supporting his nomination for #SCOTUS. This week I spoke on the @SenateFloor about the need for the #Senate to pass my bipartisan #STOPAct. My bipartisan #CARA law and the #CURES law have already made an impact in helping w/ the #opioidcrisis, but we must do more to stem the tide of addiction.   Fun to be out on #LakeErie today with my friends Capt. Dave Spangler and Capt. Paul Pacholski.  We didn't catch any walleye, but we caught a couple sheepshead.pic.twitter.com/cnrO8Rob7g I was able to see needed maintenance like cracking in the concrete on seawall that can cause erosion and small sinkholes on the island. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act funding would fix the back porch of the visitors center & access to memorial to them ADA accessible.pic.twitter.com/38jWxxyAcq Today I visited an important #Ohio landmark, Perry’s Victory & International Peace Memorial & was able to see firsthand the unmet maintenance needs that require urgent attention. My Restore Our Parks Act is needed to address these critical needs at the Perry site.pic.twitter.com/g3ItVom2iC Our Permanent Subcmte on Investigations hearing this week demonstrated the need for federal agencies to better protect unaccompanied minors from abuse & ensuring that they show up for their immigration hearings.   At the Tax Cuts to Put Americans First event in #Cincinnati earlier this week I was able to discuss how #taxreform is benefitting #Ohio by expanding businesses, creating more #jobs, raising wages & increasing benefits! … Great news from @USDA today that #BelmontCo in #Ohio will receive $60 million in funding to provide for the critical upgrades & improvements to the county’s water treatment facilities as well as spurring economic development & creating #jobs.   Alarming new @CDCgov data shows that there were 69,703 overdose deaths in the US last year. A 9% increase from the year before. #Congress must act and pass my #STOPAct & #CARA2 to help turn the tide of addiction.   On Monday I joined @VP Pence in #Cincinnati For the Tax Cuts to Put Americans First event to discuss how #taxreform is really working. Workers are seeing higher wages, bonuses, higher 401(k)s, better health care, and more! This is great news for #Ohio!   Our #GreatLakes provide vital resources to #Ohio’s economy & environment. I have worked hard to develop solutions that will protect & preserve these lakes. Here is a rundown of some of my efforts in the #Senate to make this issue a priority:   Great read from the @FreemontNM about how Erie & Ottawa counties have received over $216K in #opioidfunding that I fought for in the #CURES law. This is the 2nd year that #Ohio has received substantial funding to combat the #opioidcrisis.  This week the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations released a bipartisan report detailing a glaring need for fed. agencies to take more responsibility in ensuring the safety of #UACs & their appearance at their immigration court proceedings   Earlier this week I spoke on the @SenateFloor and urged my #Senate colleagues to pass my bipartisan #STOPAct to help turn the tide of #opioidaddiction. The #CURES & my #CARA legislation have already made an impact in helping officials combat this crisis.   Recently I introduced the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act to address the nearly $12 billion backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects at our #NationalParks by allocating existing revenues the govt already receives from on & offshore energy development   Great read about how Marion & Crawford Counties in #Ohio received more than $240K in #opioid funding I helped secure in the #CURES law. This is the 2nd year that #Ohio has received significant funding in order to combat the #opioidcrisis … The latest @CDCgov data on opioid deaths highlights the urgent need for the #Senate to pass my bipartisan #STOPAct to combat the rise of fentanyl nationally & especially in #Ohio. We must get this poison out of our communities.   Federal agencies must do a better job of protecting unaccompanied minors from human trafficking and other forms of abuse while also ensuring that these children appear at their immigration court proceedings.   Here is my opening statement as chair at the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations oversight hearing this morning on efforts to protect unaccompanied minors from human trafficking & abuse   This morning I'm chairing the Permanent Subcmtte on Investigations hearing to continue oversight of efforts of federal agencies to protect unaccompanied minors from human trafficking & abuse. Watch here:  … Congratulations to the #Wheelersburg Softball Team for winning the @LittleLeague Championship 3-0 last night! The first #Ohio team in history to do so! You’ve made our state very proud  … Tonight I spoke on the @SenateFloor & urged #Congress to address the #opioidcrisis by passing my bipartisan #STOPAct in order to keep poisonous drugs like fentanyl out of our communities. I will continue to work to combat this epidemic gripping our nation   Tomorrow, the Permanent Subcmtee on Investigations, which I chair, will hold a hearing and hear from these federal agencies.  We must do more to protect these unaccompanied minors and ensure they show up for their immigration court hearing.   Federal agencies must do more to care for unaccompanied minors and ensure they aren’t trafficked or abused. This is not a partisan issue. Many of the problems that exist today began during the Obama admin and have continued under this one.   In 2015 the Permanent Subcmtee on Investigations began its extensive oversight on this issue after HHS placed 8 unaccompanied minors into the hands of human traffickers who forced them to work on an egg farm in Marion #Ohio against their will. We cannot allow this to happen again Today along w/ @SenatorCarper, I released a new bipartisan report on federal programs designed to care for unaccompanied children & ensure they appear at their immigration court proceedings. There has been modest progress but not enough & more must be done   4 months since my bipartisan #SESTA became law, we’ve already seen a significant difference in online sex trafficking w/ the shutdown of several trafficking sites. This is great news & I’m excited to see the important progress #SESTA will continue to make.   Best of luck to the #Wheelersburg Softball Team playing tonight in the @LittleLeague Championship. You have made #Ohio proud! Support them tonight at 10 P.M. ET on @ESPN This week @POTUS signed the FY19 #NDAA into law which will provide funding to defense installations across #Ohio. I’m proud of the work accomplished in this bill for the #BuckeyeState & I will continue to support our men & women in uniform.   Good read from the @xeniagazette about how Clark, Green & Madison counties in #Ohio will receive more than $586K in #CURES funding that I fought for to combat the #opioidcrisis gripping our state. … I have known Judge #Kavanaugh for 15+ years & I know him to be a man of character & humility. He is loyal to the Constitution, and a compassionate and caring judge.  I strongly support his nomination for #SCOTUS   I’m proud to lead efforts to help preserve the Great Lakes. Whether it’s funding for #GLRI, fending off harmful algal blooms and invasive species, or other conservation efforts I will fight to ensure the Great Lakes are protected for generations to come   The Great Lakes provide drinking water for three million Ohioans and support hundreds of thousands of #jobs. We must protect and preserve them and that will continue to be one of my top priorities.   At the “Tax Cuts to Put America First” event in #Cincinnati today, I discussed the positive results from #taxreform that I’ve seen firsthand across #Ohio. #jobspic.twitter.com/LgxwLPfzGO Since #taxreform became law I have traveled across #Ohio & heard firsthand about the benefits of #taxreform from 21 different businesses. All have created #jobs, raised wages, given bonuses, invested in new plants & equipment or expanded workers’ benefits. #Taxreform works!pic.twitter.com/uAAmdOGhH9 Great to join @VP Pence, @RepSteveChabot, @RepJimRenacci, & @RepBradWenstrup at the “Tax Cuts to Put America First” event in #Cincinnati #Ohio earlier today to discuss how #taxreform is benefitting the American economy & creating more #jobs, especially in #Ohio!pic.twitter.com/qH34mMb4PG The #IRS works for the American taxpayer. For too long the agency has not been responsive and accountable, and that’s why I introduced my bipartisan Protecting Taxpayers Act in order to modernize the #IRS & help restore America’s faith in the agency.   Yesterday, @POTUS signed the FY19 #NDAA into law. It includes significant funding I worked to secure for defense installations in #Ohio including upgrades of Abram tanks &Stryker Vehicles at the JSMC in Lima. More from @limanews on how this funding is used … More good news on how #taxreform is benefitting our economy: “Small business owners’ optimism touched a 35-year high in July, with businesses setting records in terms of job creation and hiring”  … #jobs #Ohio I’ve worked to help Paint Valley #ADAMH by delivering additional opioid funding to their counties through the #CURES law enacted in 2016.  Good story here about how Paint Valley will be able to use their $573K in funding to combat the #opioidepidemic … I was proud to secure opioid funding in the 2016 #CURES legislation and I’ve seen firsthand how it is benefiting #Ohio. For the 2nd year in a row, #Ohio has received $26 million in funding to combat the #opioidcrisis.   Judge #Kavanaugh is a dedicated public servant who has chosen to spend the last 25 of his 28-year career serving the American people in various jobs. He has the experience & qualifications to serve on #SCOTUS, but most importantly to me, he’s a good person … Cyberattacks are a real & serious threat to our country. We must address this type of warfare head-on. That’s why I introduced bipartisan legislation that will establish permanent Cyber response teams at @DHSgov.  … I’ve worked to help Lorain County by delivering additional opioid funding to this community through the #CURES law enacted in 2016.  Good story here about how Lorain County will benefit from this funding to help combat the #opioidcrisis: … Later today, @POTUS will sign the FY 2019 #NDAA into law. This defense law provides needed resources to rebuild our military, to support our soldiers & to provide upgrades & support to #Ohio’s defense installations.   I have known Judge #Kavanaugh for 15+ years. He has an impressive background and is widely respected in the legal community, but just as important is he is a good person with compassion & humility. There is no one who is more qualified to serve on #SCOTUS … Protecting our #GreatLakes is a critical priority for me. I was glad that the #Senate passed bipartisan legislation last week to provide the $300 million I fought for to fully fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative which will help protect both our environment & economy Last week I wrote an op-ed outlining the dire impact the #opioidcrisis is having on our country’s workforce, and the need for businesses to step up to help combat this epidemic. Read the entire @PlainDealer piece here:  Every year, millions of people visit our #NationalParks and over time trails, bridges, buildings, water systems & roads have started to deteriorate. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will help address the $12b backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects in our #NationalParks A few flakes of #fentanyl can kill a person. Right now synthetic drugs like #fentanyl are being shipped across our border via our own Postal Service. It’s outrageous, and my #STOPAct will help put an end to this. The Senate must pass this bill.   Across #Ohio, over 140,000 jobs are open but many require skills employers can’t find. We need to bridge the skills gap! I’m pleased @POTUS signed my bipartisan Educating Tomorrow’s Workforce Act into law. It will improve the quality of #CTE programs & help kids fill that gap Americans work hard every day to provide for themselves & their families. That’s why I introduced the bipartisan Protecting Taxpayers Act to reform the #IRS and make it more responsive & accountable to the American people.   Judge #Kavanaugh is a man with great compassion, humility, and a big heart. He has the experience, qualifications and background to serve admirably on #SCOTUS and I look forward to voting to confirm his nomination. … My bipartisan #SESTA law is already making a real difference in combatting online sex trafficking and protecting women & children, by resulting in the shutdown of several websites that knowingly facilitated sex trafficking.   Cyberattacks hurt us all & quick response teams help federal agencies, critical infrastructure & key private sector partners respond to attacks. I introduced the bipartisan DHS Cyber Incident Response Teams Act to bolster cybersecurity at @DHSgov   I recently participated in a roundtable in #Whitehall to see firsthand how new grant funding awarded thru my  #CARA law is being used in innovative & effective ways to help combat the #opioidepidemic gripping the nation, especially in #Ohio #STOPAct #CARA2   I recently visited @CVNPNPS where, like many of our #NationalParks, we have backlog of maintenance projects that must be fixed or we risk losing the majesty of the Parks to wear & tear. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will #FixOurParks & preserve them for generations to come. After years of stagnant growth & flat wages, the pro-growth policies we have passed like #taxreform & regulatory reform are growing the economy, creating more #jobs, increasing wages, & expanding opportunity. Read more in my recent @TroyDailyNews op-ed:  Many Americans have had to struggle w/ the unresponsiveness of the #IRS. Taxpayers deserve to have a responsive & accountable #IRS. My bipartisan Protecting Taxpayers Act will restructure & reform the #IRS & help restore America’s faith in the agency.   According to @MissingKids, “Many sites or portions of sites where NCMEC knew children previously have been sold for sex have voluntarily shut down.” I'm glad to see my bipartisan #SESTA law which is already making a difference.   I commend the @StateDept for its increased sanctions on #Russia in response to its use of a nerve agent on a #UK citizen on #UK soil. We must do more to hold Russia accountable for its efforts to undermine our democratic institutions and values.   34 former law clerks to Judge #Kavanaugh – among them Republicans, Democrats & Independents – strongly endorse his #SCOTUS nomination in this letter.  A wonderful tribute to a judge of great compassion & character.   … #Ohio has received $26 million in #CURES funding I fought for to combat the #opioidcrisis. A positive step forward but we must do more. That’s why I continue to push for common-sense solutions like my #STOPAct & #CARA2 that will help stop this epidemic   Section 232 is a powerful trade tool used in matters of national security, but its misuse could result in loss of the tool or repercussions from other countries. My bipartisan Trade Security Act aims to reform 232 so it's used in the way it was intended & US #jobs are protected. Protecting the #GreatLakes is a vital priority of mine. #LakeErie is incredibly important to #Ohio’s economy & ecology. I continue to work to fully fund the bipartisan Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to ensure our lakes are protected & preserved.   .@POTUS has signed my bipartisan Educating Tomorrow’s Workforce Act into law. Great news for #Ohio! Students will now have access to higher quality Career & Technical Education to better prepare them for #jobs in today’s in-demand skills-based careers   As an avid outdoorsman, I enjoy spending time in our #NationalParks w/ my family, especially @CVNPNPS. These national treasures deserve to be maintained so that generations to come can enjoy them. My Restore Our Parks Act aims to make sure that happens.   I was proud to help secure the opioid funding included in the #CURES law & I have seen firsthand how it is making a difference for #Ohio. The 2nd yr of funding, $26M, has now been distributed to local communities to help combat the #opioidcrisis   New @CDCgov analysis shows that the # of pregnant women addicted to opioids quadrupled over 15 yrs. I am working to combat this. My #CARA law expands treatment for pregnant women struggling w/ addiction & my #CARA2 bill increases resources for this effort.   Thanks to my #SESTA law, victims & families of online sex trafficking are finally able to get their day in court & receive the justice the deserve. Sites that knowingly facilitated online trafficking are being shut down & this is terrific news!   I welcomed the @StateDept announcement yesterday that new sanctions will be imposed on #Russia in response to the determination that the #Russian govt used a nerve agent on a #UK citizen on #UK soil. We must continue to hold #Russia accountable for their destabilizing behavior. Recently I spoke on the @SenateFloor about #SCOTUS nominee Judge #Kavanaugh. A man of great character & integrity, he has the experience & qualifications to ably serve on the highest court in the land & I strongly support his nomination. … Our economy is growing & businesses are expanding but unfortunately the #opioidcrisis has depleted the pool of workers in #Ohio. In the @PlainDealer I highlight how employers have a responsibility to step up & do more to help #Congress combat this crisis.   Good read from @LimaYNN about my bipartisan Trade Security Act, which will reform the Section 232 tariff process to ensure it’s used for genuine national security threats w/out harming #jobs or the economy.  America is more susceptible to cyberattacks than ever before. I introduced a bipartisan bill to bolster Cyber Incident Response Teams and to make them a permanent fixture at @DHSgov in order to protect the public & private sector from cyberattacks.   We must stand with our British allies, & I’m pleased to see the Trump administration hold #Russia accountable for its actions by imposing additional sanctions.   #Russia’s dangerous assassination attempt using nerve agents on #UK soil is yet another example of its reckless & destabilizing actions on the world stage.   #TaxReform has spurred economic growth& is creating more #jobs, higher wages & more opportunities for biz & workers. An #Ohio family of 4 w/ a median income could see an avg tax cut of about $2000 a year! More on how #taxreform is working in @TroyDailyNews  Too often the federal government is not responsive to the needs of the people, & the IRS has not always served the interest of the taxpayer. My bipartisan Protecting Taxpayers Act will make the IRS more responsive & accountable to taxpayers.   Are you or a loved one interested in attending a US Service Academy? If so, then send your nomination packets to my #Columbus office. The deadline is September 21 so act fast! More information here:   It is vital to have a justice on #SCOTUS who has exceptional credentials and experience, but just as important, a good & compassionate person. After knowing him for 15+ years, I can say that Judge #Kavanaugh is that person.pic.twitter.com/umQSvmhTLY We must hold countries that violate our trade laws accountable but it’s important that we do so in a way that protects #jobs here. My Trade Security Act will reform Section 232 so that it can only be used in matters of national security as it was intended.   Did you know that #Ohio has 8 #NationalParks sites? Each one has a backlog of unmet maintenance needs & my Restore Our Parks Act will help fund the more than $100 million in needed maintenance projects at these sites!   Since my bipartisan #SESTA law was enacted, we have made real progress in curbing online sex trafficking. Many sites that trafficked women & children have been shut down & victims now have the opportunity to get the justice they deserve.   Are you or is someone you know interested in attending a United States Service Academy? You can apply for a nomination through my #Columbus office no later than September 21 so get those packets in! More information here:   Leading anti-trafficking group @MissingKids said this about my bipartisan #SESTA law: “Many sites or portions of sites where NCMEC knew children previously have been sold for sex have voluntarily shut down.”  This is great news for trafficking victims.    More good news about #jobs, our economy & the benefits of #taxreform via @MilitaryTimes: “The unemployment rate among post-9/11 veterans hit a record low last month” … My bipartisan #SESTA law is already making a real difference in combatting online sex trafficking, resulting in the shutdown of several websites that knowingly facilitated sex trafficking. There’s much more to be done, but this is a great start.   Employers have a responsibility to step up & do more to help us end the #opioidcrisis. In @ThePlainDealer I discuss the need to help those get the treatment they need & re-enter the workforce where they can have the dignity that comes w/ having a #job.   Important read in the @gd_trib about the youngest victims of the #opioidepidemic, infants born dependent on drugs. My #CARA2 will expand treatment options for mothers addicted to opioids so that their children have the best chances for a healthy life: … Last week @POTUS signed my Educating Tomorrow’s Workforce Act into law. It will encourage schools to incorporate key elements of high-quality #CTE programs & promote partnerships between local businesses & industries to help students get the skills they need for today’s #jobs Judge #Kavanaugh is known for fairly and impartially applying the law & the Constitution rather than legislating from the bench and most importantly, he’s a good, compassionate man with great character. He is a terrific choice for #SCOTUS & I strongly support his confirmation.pic.twitter.com/JUpyQlDwg8 Every year, millions of people visit our #NationalParks and over time trails, bridges, building, & roads have started to deteriorate. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will help to #FixOurParks so that we can all continue to enjoy their splendor.   My bipartisan Trade Security Act will increase congressional oversight over the Section 232 tariff process & reform it to ensure these tariffs are used for genuine threats to national security. This bill has already garnered support. See more here   The #opioidcrisis continues to devastate communities across #Ohio. Businesses can’t find qualified workers to fill in-demand positions b/c this epidemic has depleted the pool. In the @PlainDealer I discuss how I’m working to turn this tide   #CARA2 #STOPAct On the @SenateFloor I discussed my bipartisan Trade Security Act that I introduced this week. This bill preserves the Section 232 trade tool for genuine national security threats and increases the oversight role of Congress in the process. … Recently the PSI, which I chair, released a bipartisan report on how some federal agencies are not properly reporting their spending as required by the #DATAAct. This is unacceptable. Taxpayers have a right to know exactly how their $$ is being spent. … I’m pleased that @POTUS signed by bipartisan Educating Tomorrow’s Workforce Act into law last week. It will improve the quality of #CTE programs and help kids get the education & skills they need to find in-demand #jobs in today’s economy.   Earlier this week I introduced bipartisan legislation that will bolster cybersecurity by requiring DHS to make permanent the “cyber hunt” &“cyber incident response” teams that work to help prevent cyberattacks in the public & private sector   Opioids continue to devastate the lives  of Americans every day. It is alarming how simple it is to get ahold of illegal synthetic drugs like fentantyl b/c labs in #China to send them through our US Postal System. My bipartisan #STOPACT aims to stop this: … Protecting the #GreatLakes is one of my top priorities & I was glad that the #Senate passed a bill this week to provide the $300 million I fought for to fully fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative which will help protect both our environment &economy   Recently I spoke on the @SenateFloor about my full support for #SCOTUS nominee, Judge #Kavanaugh. I know him as a person of character & integrity. … For centuries our #NationalParks have generated awe & wonder for the millions of people who visit them. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will help fund long-term maintenance projects so that people can continue to enjoy them for generations to come … This week I introduced bipartisan legislation called the Trade Security Act which will work to reform Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to better align the statute w/ its original intent & ensure it’s used for genuine national security threats.   The #Senate has confirmed the most circuit court nominees through a president’s second year since George H.W. Bush’s presidency. These judges will have a positive impact on our nation’s courts for many years to come. To date, the Senate has confirmed 51 judicial nominees this Congress, including 24 circuit court judges that hear appeals from trial courts. Real progress in confirming judges that will apply the law as it is written. My 14th year competing in #Paddlefest. Thanks to everyone who came out to compete & volunteer to raise money for the Outdoor Adventure Clubs of Greater #Cincinnati which connects urban high school students to the outdoors.pic.twitter.com/NSxbc2Q6S5 Beautiful morning on the #OhioRiver to compete again in the 9-mile #Paddlefest race — to support the Outdoor Adventure Clubs of Greater #Cincinnati!pic.twitter.com/auBXSAjZDN Yesterday I participated in a roundtable in #Whitehall and saw firsthand how grant money awarded through my bipartisan #CARA law is being used to fund #SAFE Stations where people can do to request help w/ their addictionpic.twitter.com/FbAMAB4fAF Proud to attend the opening ceremonies for #Pelotonia last night.

We thank our first responders for their efforts & are praying for a safe conclusion for everyone involved. Last night on the @SenateFloor I discussed my bipartisan Trade Security Act, which will help guide our trade policy and ensure that we keep national security & trade issues separate, ensuring a strong economy & #jobs.   Great video, & why the House & Senate must pass my Restore Our Parks Act to preserve these treasures for generations to come. … This morning on @BloombergTV I discussed the need to resolve our #trade issues with #China by increasing direct talks between our countries and imposing new sanctions on #Russia in order to change its destabilizing behavior.   The #GreatLakes are an invaluable resource to #Ohio & the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative helps protect both our environment & our economy. I’m pleased to help secure full funding for #GLRI in bipartisan legislation passed by the #Senate today   I have repeatedly expressed concern that misuse of Section 232 could have a detrimental impact on #Ohio #jobs & the US economy. My bipartisan Trade Security Act will reform Section 232 & increase congressional oversight so it is preserved for genuine national security threats. My bipartisan Trade Security Act will reform Section 232 to ensure that the Defense Department justifies the national security basis for new tariffs under Section 232 and increase the oversight role of Congress. #Jobs   We must hold countries that violate our trade laws accountable but without endangering US #jobs or our economy. That’s why I introduced the bipartisan Trade Security Act to preserve the Section 232 tool for genuine threats to national security. #Jobs   Today I introduced the bipartisan Trade Security Act w/ @SenDougJones & @SenJoniErnst that will reform the Section 232 trade statute to ensure it is used solely for national security issues & increase congressional oversight. #jobs   I introduced a bipartisan bill with @SenatorHassan in order to bolster #cybersecurity by requiring DHS to make permanent the Cyber Incident Response Teams to protect the US from cyber attacks in both the private and public sectors.   Our #NationalParks are a place of majesty & wonder for millions of people. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will help maintain & restore our parks so that generations to come can marvel at their natural beauty.  I believe that Judge #Kavanaugh is the most qualified nominee for #SCOTUS. In addition to his immense qualifications, he is also a good man with a big heart. I look forward to supporting his nomination.pic.twitter.com/pfthwDfQeI Proud to give remarks at the @GoParks reception highlighting my bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act.

Through partnership with #Akron Public Schools & the @LJFamFoundation, he was able to fulfill his dream of opening a new school, I Promise, in #Akron. … Had a successful tele town-hall tonight with northwest Ohio. Great questions about solving the multiemployer pension crisis, the #opioidcrisis, the federal budget & much more. On @MeetThePress yesterday morning I discussed the need for additional sanctions against #Russia & how we must keep up the pressure until it changes its behavior. Its illegal occupation of Crimea is just one example   The @AkronBeacon editorial board praised my Restore Our Parks bill which will help address the $12 billion backlog in funding for long delayed maintenance projects at our #NationalParks so that we can preserve our national treasures for generations to come   The #NDAA is a win for our efforts to rebuild our military, for our soldiers & for #Ohio! This important measure authorizes funding for #Ohio’s military installations & I’m proud to support our men & women in uniform.   As I told @MeetThePress yesterday morning that I believe Judge #Kavanaugh is humble, compassionate and he is going to do an incredible job during his #SCOTUS confirmation hearings.   I spoke on the @SenateFloor earlier this week about my PSI bipartisan report detailing how federal agencies have not properly documented their spending as required by the #DATAAct. It’s important taxpayers know exactly how their money is being spent. … On Friday I participated in a roundtable w/ @UnitedWaySummit to discuss how my #CURES legislation has enabled @SummaHealth to start a pilot program that will help victims of the #opioidcrisis get on the right path to treatment & recoverypic.twitter.com/FLO6inQCcP Judge #Kavanaugh is a man of integrity and humility who won’t legislate from the bench. I have had the pleasure of knowing him for more than 15 years and I believe he is the right person for #SCOTUS I commend @SecPompeo for his declaration just before the Foreign Relations hearing earlier this week that the US will not recognize #Russia’s illegal occupation of #Crimea. The US continues to stand with #Ukraine. I joined my #Senate colleagues in applauding the Foreign Relations Cmte for passing my bipartisan Tropical Forest Conservation Reauthorization Act. It will protect millions of acres of tropical forest from deforestation and reduce greenhouse emission   My bipartisan #CTE bill is going to @POTUS to be signed into law. I spoke on the @SenateFloor earlier this week about the importance of this bill to allow states & localities to use Perkins Grant funding to establish #CTE focused academies … I join @MeetThePress in an hour to discuss the US’s foreign relations, #trade, & my support for Judge #Kavanaugh. Make sure to tune in!  #IfItsSunday This week I introduced bipartisan legislation, the Protect Taxpayers Act,  to reform a number of #IRS functions & administrative practices to make them more responsive & accountable to taxpayers.   Yesterday I had the opportunity to tour the @ACRFoodbank in #Akron #Ohio. I appreciate the time & hard-work of all the workers & volunteers, and I know their community truly values their service.pic.twitter.com/5Wmn4iKKpN Until #Russia ends their illegal seizure of #Crimea, the US must continue to enforce our strict sanctions. I applaud #Senate Foreign Relations for passing my resolution this week strongly condemning #Russia’s illegal occupation. The US stands with #Ukraine   My Permanent Subcmte on Investigations released a bipartisan report highlighting some federal agencies have not accurately reported their federal spending as required by the #DATAAct. This is unacceptable & we have offered recs to get them back on track   Tune in tomorrow morning to @MeetThePress as I discuss #Kavanaugh for #SCOTUS, #Russia, and more! #IfItsSunday In @Troydailynews I discuss why I support Judge #Kavanaugh. He’s  a widely respected legal scholar & more importantly, a good man. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing him for 15+ years. No one better  qualified for #SCOTUS.   Great roundtable today in #Akron #Ohio with @SummaHealth & @UnitedWaySummit to discuss their emergency room Pilot Opiate Overdose Program which was made possible due in part to funding I helped secure in the bipartisan #CURES legislation.pic.twitter.com/3AiyBYdgVC I had the opportunity to visit & tour @ACRFoodbank today. I’m immensely grateful for the time and hard work that the workers and volunteers put into serving the #Akron community every day.pic.twitter.com/EOz3uq3ipy Just had an inspiring tour at the @ACRFoodbank today. A great community effort to provide food all over the Akron-Canton area.pic.twitter.com/i0cHbVdcJa This year the #NDAA conference report includes funding I fought for that will enable @910AW to relocate their main gate in order to improve security as well as the flow of traffic of people exiting & entering the base.pic.twitter.com/IyO30v2bVv Proud to participate in the ribbon cutting for the new firing ranges at  @910AW this morning. I pushed to secure funding in the 2016 #NDAA to ensure that our #Youngstown reservists have the training they need to carry out their operations.pic.twitter.com/U0Cc1awAlU Last night I spoke on the @SenateFloor honoring two brave Capitol Police Officers, Jacob Chestnut & Detective John Gibson, who gave their lives in the line of duty when a gunman opened fire in the US Capitol 20 years ago. May their heroic efforts never be forgotten.pic.twitter.com/G9GgBOhFZ0 I applaud the #Senate Foreign Relations cmte for passing my bipartisan Tropical Forest Conservation Reauthorization Act, which helps protect our natural resources for the next generation while strengthening ties with other countries.   The United States continues to stand w/ #Ukraine against #Russian aggression. I’m glad the Foreign Relations Cmte passed my bipartisan resolution strongly condemning #Russia’s illegal occupation of #Crimea.   Today I introduced bipartisan legislation that will restore staffing levels at Union Terminal in #Cincinnati as well as other major @Amtrak stations across the country.   My bipartisan #CTE bill passed the #House yesterday and is now on the way to @POTUS to be signed into law. This legislation will help students get the career & technical education they need, regardless of economic standing, to pursue their American dream. … It has been 20 years since the last significant #IRS reform, and it is time to update the agency once again. The bipartisan Protecting Taxpayers Act will restructure & reform the #IRS to make it more responsive & accountable to the needs of taxpayers   Too often, the federal government isn’t responsive to the needs of the people it serves, and the #IRS has not always served the interests of taxpayers. That’s why I introduced the Protecting Taxpayers Act today to reform the #IRS   This morning, I will chair an @GOPSenFinance subcmte hearing on #IRS reform solutions. Proud to intro legislation with my colleague @SenatorCardin today to make the #IRS more responsive & accountable to taxpayers   This afternoon at a #Senate Foreign Relations hearing, I pressed Secretary Pompeo on imposing additional sanctions on #Russia and urged him to maintain those strict sanctions as long as #Russia continues to illegally occupy #Ukraine.   Good read from @Reuters on my bipartisan investigation: "Senate probe finds massive errors in program detailing U.S. agency spending"  … #Ohio My bipartisan #CTE bill has passed the #House & is headed to @POTUS’ desk to be signed into law! This is great news for #Ohio, for employers who need skilled workers & for students to ensure they have access to the highest-quality CTE programs!   This is very important, and good news! … Today Senator @ChrisCoons & I met w/ the UK Secretary of State @LiamFox to reaffirm our 2 nations’ strong economic relationship & our commitment to pursuing a mutually-beneficial bilateral trade agreement after the Brexit process is complete.pic.twitter.com/jOEXRIvWOS Protecting our #NationalParks is one of my top priorities. They have been our national treasures for more than 100 years. My Restore Our Parks Act will help address long-term maintenance backlog to keep the majesty of our parks for generations to come.   I enjoyed meeting w/@usa_retirement, students from @OhioState, interns from @SenSherrodBrown’s office & more than 40 #Ohioans at today’s #Buckeye Constituent Coffee. We had great conversations on #pensions, #DATAAct and more!pic.twitter.com/CoZyNKiJWi 25 IG Reports reviewed by the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations, which I chair, found more than half of the data submitted to   from fed. agencies – about $240 bill in spending – was inaccurate. This is unacceptable:   In the @highlandcopress I discuss how Judge #Kavanaugh is a legal scholar who respects the Constitution and won’t legislate from the bench. He’s a good man and who should be confirmed for #SCOTUS to address issues that affect #Ohioans & Americans.   On @MSNBC earlier today I discussed my bipartisan #SESTA law that helps ensure justice for victims of online sex trafficking. Contrary to claims by some, selling women & children online is not constitutionally protected speech.   Today marks 20 years since a gunman entered the Capitol & killed Capitol Police Officers Jacob Chestnut & John Gibson. I'll never forget that day, and I’m proud to wear my pin honoring the men & women of the @CapitolPolice who protect us every day. Thank you for your service.pic.twitter.com/vnBcuKE4LS As Judge #Kavanaugh's Harvard Law students will tell you, his loyalty lies w/ the Constitution. He interprets the law & Constitution  without imposing his own point of view. More in my op-ed for @TheDailyCall: … I recently met with Judge #Kavanaugh and saw the compassion, humility, big heart & readiness to serve of the friend I’ve known for 15+ years. I can’t imagine a more qualified nominee for #SCOTUS.pic.twitter.com/srT0SgQXiI The #Senate passed my bipartisan bill to strengthen career & technical education earlier today. This bill will help #Ohioans get the training they need for today’s jobs, regardless of economic standing   I appreciate all the hard work that has gone into   to date, but we must continue to hold agencies accountable for providing accurate spending data.  More on my bipartisan report here:   A functioning   will improve transparency & help policymakers identify & eliminate gov. waste. My report today outlines recs to improve data submissions by federal agencies & give policymakers & the public the information they deserve   The #DATAAct was designed to empower the American public & policymakers w/ timely & accurate information on how taxpayer money is spent, but most agencies fail to comply with the law. Read more about my bipartisan report here:   The Permanent Subcmte on Investigations, which I chair, unveiled a bipartisan report w/ @SenatorCarper detailing the failure of federal agencies to submit accurate data on how they spend taxpayer dollars   Proud to support the mission of #NASIC & @WrightPattAFB, and pleased we succeeded in authorizing critical funding to begin the modernization effort so that they can continue their important work   The #NDAA conference report includes important funding I fought for to help our @OHNationalGuard units training at Camp Ravenna & @910AW   #Ohio I’m pleased that the #NDAA conference report authorizes additional funding for producing Stryker A1 vehicles & Abrams Tanks. A big win & support for our troops at the #JSMC in #Lima   #Ohio I’m proud that my bipartisan #SESTA law has already started to have a lasting impact in reducing online sex trafficking. Websites known to facilitate sex trafficking are shutting down, one step closer to ensuring justice for victims of this horrific crime  Last week I spoke on the @SenateFloor urging my #Senate colleagues to pass my bipartisan #STOPAct. The #opioidepidemic claims hundreds of lives every day & we must act now to help stop this poison from being shipped into our communities. … This weekend I had the opportunity to tour the beautiful @CVNPNPS & see firsthand the maintenance needed. My Restore Our Parks Act will allocate funding for the park & the 7 other #Ohio #NationalParks to address this long-term maintenance backlog.pic.twitter.com/EW6eMYlIDa My bipartisan Gold Star Spouses Leasing Relief Act was created to protect the surviving spouses of servicemembers who have died during their military service. Great read in @IrontonTribune about how this bill will aid military spouses: … It’s a fact: Judge #Kavanaugh is an immensely qualified, highly respected judge & most importantly, he’s a good man with a big heart. He is the right nominee for #SCOTUS and I’m proud to support his confirmation.pic.twitter.com/f4Nky6Hkgx Earlier this week the Department of @ENERGY transferred 80 acres of land to the Southern Ohio Diversification Initiative in #Piketon. This will encourage development and have a positive economic impact on the region. According to @MissingKids a leading national antitrafficking group: Many sites or portions of sites where NCMEC knew children previously had been sold for sex have voluntarily shut down. Good news that demonstrates how my bipartisan #SESTA is working to help end human trafficking I was pleased to announce earlier this week that @DOTMARAD awarded Ironhead Marine, Inc in #Toledo a federal grant to help to increase the capacity of the #Toledo shipyard and boost the local economy   #jobs The Senate should act to pass my bipartisan #STOPAct now to help stop the influx of illegal synthetic drugs like fentanyl from entering our communities thru our US Postal system via #China. I spoke on the @SenateFloor urging my colleagues to pass this bill  Jane and I enjoyed an inspiring service from our friend, Bishop Larry Macon (@drmacon) today at Mt. Zion Church of Oakwood Village. It was nice to catch up with Bishop Macon, his wife Marilyn and their son Rev.

I’m pleased that the #House passed my bipartisan #DELTAAct which encourages the US to develop strategy to protect it.   Judge #Kavanaugh is man of integrity & humility. He is highly qualified for #SCOTUS & I hope my #Senate colleagues will join me in voting to confirm him  #SESTA becoming law was a critical step forward in combating online sex trafficking in America. I spoke on the @SenateFloor earlier this week about the positive impact #SESTA has had already in shutting down sites that facilitated trafficking.h Thankful to everyone who participated & volunteered at the #VeloSano #biketocure today. Cancer has hit so many of our families, including Jane’s  & mine.

It sends a clear message that America stands w/ #Ukrainians in their efforts to secure a democratic & prosperous future in the face of #Russian aggression    … A few flakes of #fentanyl can kill a person; unfortunately accidental overdoses are at an all time high. I spoke on the @SenateFloor about my bipartisan #STOPAct which will gives law enforcement the tools they need to help stop the influx of this poison in our communities According to @MissingKids, a leading anti-trafficking group in the country, “there has been a major disruption in the online marketplace” since #SESTA was enacted & “it is much harder to purchase a child online.” That’s great news. And that’s exactly what we intended #SESTA to do Last night I spoke on the @SenateFloor in order to provide an update on my bipartisan #SESTA law. #SESTA is already making a difference in reducing online sex trafficking, and multiple known websites that facilitated trafficking have been shut down! … I’m glad the Department of @ENERGY has transferred 80 acres of land to #SODI and I look forward to the positive impact this will have on the local economy in #Piketon #Ohio.   Very well done! #Believeland … #Agriculture is one of Ohio’s largest industries, contributing $93 billion yearly to the State’s economy.

I would urge the entire #Senate to support this bill.   I had the privilege of sitting down with Judge #Kavanaugh last week to discuss his #SCOTUS nomination. I can’t think of a better qualified person for this role and I’m proud to support his nomination: … As a lifelong outdoorsman and frequent visitor to #Ohio’s #NationalParks, it is vital to me that we protect their legacies for generations to come. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will help to maintain these national treasures.   At @GOPSenFinance hearing yesterday I urged @CBP to use my bipartisan #ENFORCEAct in order to crack down on illegal trade instead of Section232 which should only be used in matters of national security. Misuse of 232 could result in #tradewars w/our allies   Another sign #taxreform is working to create #jobs & improve our economy: Jobless claims at their lowest level since 1969, per this report from @business:  … #Ohio I had the opportunity to meet with a group of exceptionally bright students today from #Ohio.

The United States continues to stand with the #Ukraine against #Russian aggression.   From my @TroyDailyNews #taxreform column: For the median income family in #Ohio, the average tax cut is about $2,000 per year. This will help enable families to pay down student debt, invest in their retirement or take a long-awaited family vacation  Did you know the Cuyahoga Valley National Park @CVNPNPS in #Ohio has more than $45mill in long-delayed maintenance projects? My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act would address this backlog & ensure our #NationalParks can be enjoyed for generations to come   Wonderful news that the 12 boys & their soccer coach were rescued after being trapped for more than 2 weeks in a flooded cave. I extend my wholehearted congratulations to the Thai Navy & supporting personnel who worked tirelessly & perilously to rescue them. I look forward to meeting with Judge Kavanaugh in the coming weeks. Here is my full statement on the president’s #SCOTUS nominee:pic.twitter.com/OS80CfwOYJ Judge Kavanaugh has an impressive background & I look forward to meeting with him in the coming weeks as he goes through a fair & thorough evaluation process.   #SCOTUS I look forward to considering the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as the next Associate Justice of @USSupremeCourt. A #SCOTUS justice must fairly and impartially apply the law & protect the rights guaranteed of the Constitution.   From my @TroyDailyNews column on the success of #taxreform: “The new tax code is also more progressive—meaning those at the top end of the income ladder pay a larger portion of the overall tax burden and those with lower incomes pay less.” … It was my honor to address a naturalization ceremony in #Cincinnati on Friday where I helped welcome 73 new American citizens. It was inspiring to learn the stories and I was proud to be on hand to congratulate everyone. The admin must make more progress, more quickly, in reuniting these children w/ their families at the border. We can have strong border security w/out separating kids from their families & I will continue to push the Senate to pass the Keep Families Together & Enforce the Law Actpic.twitter.com/5k0EsnwcRr Looking forward to #POTUS’ #SCOTUS announcement tonight & meeting with him or her in the coming weeks. As I’ve said many times, the job of a Supreme Court justice is to fairly and impartially apply the law, not legislate from the bench. Did you know that #Ohios 8 #NationalParks has backlog that will cost more than $100 mill to fix? My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will help tackle this problem by allocating existing unused revenues the gov receives from on&offshore energy development   We continue to make progress in the fight against #opioidabuse. A #Senate bill that passed last week included additional funding for my bipartisan #CARA law to help address the overprescribing of #opioids for our #veterans struggling with #opioidaddiction.   As co-chair of the #Senate Ukraine Caucus I am urging @DeptofDefense to help ensure #Ukrainian soldiers receive quality health care. It sends a strong signal to #Russia that the US is willing to pursue all options to ensure Ukraine’s stability & success   Across #Ohio, employers stress the urgent need to bridge the skills gap. #Ohioans should have access to the training needed for today’s #jobs. I’m working to pass my bipartisan Educating Tomorrow’s Workforce Act to improve the quality of #CTE programs   The good news in this #jobs report reflects what I’m hearing as I travel #Ohio. I’ve visited 21 businesses & they tell me that #taxreform is helping to create more #jobs, raise wages, expand investment, increase retirement benefits & much more.   The #Cincinnati @Enquirer reported that #HamiltonCo has had a 1,000x increase in #fentanyl deaths since 2013. This is terrifying & unacceptable, it’s time we stop this poison from entering our communities & my #STOPAct will help. Read more in my op-ed:   According to a @CDCgov study the chances of #opioidaddiction increases substantially after 4 days of RX medication. To help end this crisis, I introduced the bipartisan #CARA2 which builds upon my #CARA law & limits opioid RXs for acute pain to only 3 days   I was pleased that the #Senate passed the #FarmBill last week which will provide #Ohio farmers with the certainty and predictability they deserve. Also includes provisions I fought for to promote economic development and expand access to broadband in our rural communities For more than a century #NationalParks like Cuyahoga Valley have inspired Americans to explore the natural beauty of our nation. I introduced the Restore Our Parks Act to address the $12 billion deferred maintenance backlog so they can continue to inspire   Yesterday I toured the new @PrevFIRST facility in #Cincinnati, an anti-drug  group I founded more than 20 years ago. I talked w/ the organization’s leadership team to learn more about how they are using the $50,000 #CARA grant they recently received.pic.twitter.com/t7YKrlNJjl Good story about fatherhood and my friend @JohnnyBench_5.  Being a father is one of life’s great joys, and I know Johnny agrees! … I spoke on the @SenateFloor about the need for the #Senate to pass my bipartisan #STOPAct. It’s important that we keep illegal synthetic drugs like #fentanyl out of our communities & my #STOPAct will provide law enforcement the tools they need to help  In only 6 months, #taxreform has helped create a better economy & a brighter future for #Ohioans. Now #Congress needs to come together to make #taxreform permanent and continue this positive momentum.

Bush, a very happy birthday! #HBD43pic.twitter.com/OXyMHS9agG As I’ve said over the last month, the kids who have been separated from their families should be reunited with them as quickly as possible. We can have stronger border security without separating families & that is why I support the Keep Families Together & Enforce the Law Act. Good news in today’s #jobs report. More Americans re-entering the workforce to look for #jobs, 213,000 new #jobs added & wages are rising as well. #TaxReform is working to grow our economy. I introduced the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act alongside #Senate colleagues, @MarkWarner, @SenAlexander, & @SenAngusKing to address the deferred maintenance backlog at our #NationalParks so we can continue to protect these national treasures   In the #Piqua @TheDailyCall I discuss how #taxreform is helping #Ohio through programs called opportunity zones that encourages private investment in lower-income communities. This could end up as one of the most helpful aspects of #taxreform for #Ohioans  Last week the #Senate passed the #FarmBill which includes an important provision to help fund addiction treatment in rural areas. The #opioidcrisis is hitting America hard especially in the rural community &this is an important step in ending #opioidcrisis   On the @SenateFloor last week I highlighted the success of #taxreform since it became law 6 months ago. In #Ohio, I’ve visited 21 businesses that all say #taxreform has helped them increase wages, create more #jobs, expand benefits, and more! It’s working!   China continues to ship illegal synthetic drugs like #fentanyl into the US via the mail system & law enforcement doesnt have the tools needed to effectively screen the packages. In my @Enquirer op-ed I discuss how my #STOPAct will give them the right tools   Protecting our #NationalParks is one of my top priorities. I introduced the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act to address the nearly $12 billion in maintenance backlog at the @NatlParkService including more than $100 mill for #Ohio’s 8 national parks.   Fun with the family over the 4th at one of Ohio’s hidden treasures, The Wilds east of #Zanesville in Muskingum  County.

Good read from @RollCall on our bipartisan effort … Terrific read from @CleClinicNews. I had the great fortune of meeting Jacoby & her family last week to discuss the incredible work that @ClevelandClinic Children’s Hospital does every day to help kids live full & happy lives.   #Ohio I applaud the @FBI & its law enforcement partners for their hard work in thwarting this terrorist plot in #Cleveland. Underscores the ongoing threat we face from homegrown terrorism.  … #Ohio We know where illegal synthetic drugs like #fentanyl are coming from - #China & we know how they’re getting here – US Postal Service. In my @Enquirer op-ed, I urge #Congress to give law enforcement the tools they need to help stop the flow of these drugs   After 2 years of hard work I’m pleased to report #Congress is making significant progress on my bipartisan #STOPAct. I wrote an op-ed for @Enquirer highlighting why this is important & how it will make a real difference in combating the #opioidcrisis   #Ohio .@KingJames thrilled us again this season with a playoff run to remember.

If they don’t, Congress should act quickly on a legislative solution and I’m working with my colleagues to do so.   Based on my Senate PSI investigation, we know that HHS and DHS are not prepared to effectively deal with even more unaccompanied minors.  . See more on our oversight efforts here:  … As I have said consistently, including to @WLWT last week, I oppose the administration’s policy of separating children from their parents at the border. We can have strong border security without separating families.  …. More here:   Here is my statement reiterating my opposition to the Trump admin policy of separating families at the border.pic.twitter.com/68xivO7zr6 I was pleased that the Senate passed the FY2019 #NDAA which will help support our troops. While our country faces security threats around the world, this bipartisan legislation will ensure our soldiers have the resources they need to accomplish their national security missions. I was pleased that the Senate passed the FY 2019 #NDAA which will help support our troops and increase their well-deserved pay. I am particularly pleased that several of my key initiatives were included which will benefit #Ohio’s defense installations.   The Permanent Subcmte on Investigations which I chair released results of an investigation of #IranDeal showing the Obama admin misled the American people by issuing a special license that would allow Iran to convert assets using the US Financial System   Unlike illegal drugs that are smuggled over land, most illegal fentanyl is manufactured & shipped from labs in #China to the US via our own Postal System. I co-wrote an op-ed w/ @RepMikeBishop for @detroitnews about how my #STOPAct will help combat this   Strong momentum behind the bipartisan #STOPAct to help combat the #opioidcrisis. House passed it last week. Making progress in the Senate & the @washingtonpost ed board now supports the bill. “Opioids Come From China in the US Mail. Here’s How to Stop it.” … The @washingtonpost ed board endorsed my bipartisan #STOPAct over the weekend. Good read here: “Opioids Come From #China in the U.S. Mail. Here’s How to Stop it.” … The House passed my bipartisan #STOPAct last week to help keep illegal synthetic drugs like fentanyl off of our streets. I spoke on the @SenateFloor about the need for the Senate to follow suit so we can help prevent this poison out of our communities.  20 years ago I helped start @PrevFirst as a comprehensive effort to help combat youth substance abuse. I’m honored that they will be able to benefit from a $50,000 grant through my bipartisan #CARA legislation & help prevent youth #opioidabuse   Friday is the six-month anniversary of when the new #taxreform law was enacted. I’ve visited 20 businesses across #Ohio that have announced higher pay, better benefits, and more #jobs as a result of the money saved through #taxreform.pic.twitter.com/60gdSv6w9s #Opioidaddiction is unfortunately at an all-time high across #Ohio & in our nation. My bipartisan #CARA2 will limit RXs for opioid to 3 days for acute pain to help reduce the number of people who become addicted to #opioids & help end the #opioidcrisis   Thank to my bipartisan #CARA legislation, we’re getting more resources to our first responders across the country and especially in #Ohio to combat the #opioidepidemic. My #CARA2 will increase funding for first responders and make more progress in ending the #opioidcrisis. Because of our old, broken tax code, @honeywell @Intelligrated in #Mason #Ohio were forced to keep many profits overseas. Thanks to #taxreform, they are now bringing $7 billion back to the US to help reinvest in their business & their employees!pic.twitter.com/uJtgDwvIYi We’re getting closer to getting my #STOPAct signed into law, which will help combat this #opioidepidemic.  Passed the House last week & now making progress in the #Senate. This bill will make a big difference for #Ohio  . I spoke on the @SenateFloor earlier this week about my bipartisan #STOPAct. A few flakes of the synthetic drug fentanyl can easily cause an overdose and this poison is coming into our communities in record numbers through our US mail. It must be stopped. … Earlier this week the @GOPSenFinance passed the #CRIBAct, which will allow newborns born dependent on #opioids to get the quality care they need. I’m now pushing the full #Senate to pass this bill so we can work to get it signed into law.   The Senate is expected to soon consider bipartisan legislation that includes many of my #GreatLakes priorities, including increasing funding for Great Lakes Restoration Initiative & upgrading our water infrastructure   #jobs #Ohio Protecting our #GreatLakes is a critical priority for me. I’ve led efforts to restore full funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative in order to protect our environment and economy in #Ohio, and I will continue to do so.   #jobs This week @USDOT announced that they will award the #Ohio Rail Development Commission more than $16 million in funding to support critical improvements and help usher in a new wave of economic development & #jobs in SE #Ohio.   #Taxreform is working to create more #jobs, increase wages, pay bonuses, expand retirement benefits, and increase investment,  just to name a few. Read more in my op-ed from the #Youngstown @Vindicator here: … I had the opportunity to tour #HelpingHandsHealthcare yesterday as a part of my Results for the Middle Class Tax Reform Tour. With their tax savings from #taxreform, Helping Hands was able to purchase the building they have been leasing for the past 17 years. #Ohiopic.twitter.com/nMVGLaKiwd The House passed my bipartisan #STOPAct this week, which will give law enforcement the tools they need to help stop the deadly influx of synthetic drugs like fentanyl from coming into our communities through the US mail. Now the Senate’s must act.   My #FAST41 law speeds up construction projects by streamlining the permitting process. At @GOPEnergy hearing this week I pressed FERC to comply with the law that requires agencies to post deadlines so we can rebuild our infrastructure & create more #jobs   I had the pleasure of introducing @VP Pence this afternoon at the Tax Cuts to Put America First Event in #Columbus #Ohio. @VP is a good friend and an important voice for #taxreform and it was my honor to introduce him.pic.twitter.com/SotFModQB2 I had an insightful panel discussion this afternoon with @WarrenDavidson, @RepMikeTurner and Bob Kessler of @KesslerSignCo about how #taxreform has positively impacted businesses in #Ohiopic.twitter.com/i1r4N3m9wb As a part of my Results for the Middle Class Tax Reform Tour I participated in a roundtable today with local #smallbiz and Helping Hands Healthcare in #Cincinnati to discuss the positive impact #taxreform is having on the community   #jobs #Ohio I had a productive roundtable with #HelpingHandsHealthcare in #Cincinnati earlier today. Thanks to savings from the new #taxreform law, they were able to reinvest in their business & purchase the building they have been leasing for the past 17 years. #Ohiopic.twitter.com/Vr0Ara00NE As a result of #taxreform, biz like @Honeywell @Intelligrated are able to bring back $$ to the US that was overseas b/c of the old international tax rate. This means more money for @Intelligrated to expand, hire more workers, & increase retirement benefits for employees #jobs Today I visited @Honeywell @intelligrated in #Mason #Ohio for my 19th official stop in my Results for the Middle Class Tax Reform Tour. Thanks to #taxreform  Honeywell will be bringing $7 bill from overseas in the next 2 years to expand biz and reinvest in their workers!pic.twitter.com/ryuaFiRUrl My bipartisan #STOPAct will help stop the shipment of illegal synthetic drugs thru our US mail system. By giving law enforcement the tools they need to identify & stop these drugs from entering the US, we can begin to rid our communities of this poison.   On the @SenateFloor last night I spoke about my bipartisan #STOPAct. Yesterday the House passed this measure w/ a strong bipartisan vote & I urged my Senate colleagues to do the same. It’s time we get these dangerous #opioids like #fentanyl off our streets   Today the House of Reps passed my #STOPAct w/ @AmyKlobuchar, which will help stop the flow of #fentanyl being shipped into the US via our mail system. Appreciate working w/@RepKevinBrady @RepMikeBishop & @RepJohnFaso to pass this bill on a bipartisan basis   Today my staff participated in a special event at @rockhall in #Cleveland celebrating #FlagDay, @USArmy 243rd Birthday & a Naturalization Ceremony welcoming 30 new citizens from 18 countries. Thank you to our veterans & service members. HBD @USArmy & congrats to our new citizens!pic.twitter.com/IUN5HhlA87 Happy 243rd birthday to the United States Army! Thank you to all of the brave men and women of the @USArmy who have and continue to put their lives on the line to protect our great nation!pic.twitter.com/zfqMqUQXrB Pleased to see the WH formally endorse the #STOPAct, saying it “would strengthen the ability of CBP agents to target their efforts against areas most notorious for producing and trafficking opioids, including #fentanyl.” More here:  … #Taxreform continues to create more #jobs & economic opportunity. Good news this morning via @AP: “Retail sales post sharp gains in May, signaling a surge in U.S. economic growth”  At @DCExaminer “Examining Opioids” event this morning I highlighted my efforts to end the #opioidcrisis.
