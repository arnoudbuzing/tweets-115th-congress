In one generation, our family went from cotton to Congress. #MLK50 My grandfather was born in 1921 in South Carolina, a very different time for race relations in our country. He left school in the 3rd grade to pick cotton, was forced to use a different water fountain, and had to use a certain side of the street. #MLK50 It would be impossible to put into words the depth of the impact he had and continues to have on so many people, so I will leave you with a story. #MLK50 Fifty years after his death, his words continue to inspire us to push forward and defy all obstacles. ‘If you can’t fly, run. If you can’t run, walk. If you can’t walk, crawl, but by all means, keep moving.' #MLK50 Dr. King helped to show us that the insurmountable power of love has the ability to conquer all evil. #MLK50 Today let us celebrate the amazing legacy of a giant among men, a trailblazer who devoted his life to spreading the true meaning of unity, peace, and the relentless pursuit of brighter days. #MLK50 Newly designated "Opportunity Zones" reach every corner of our state- from Myrtle Beach to Rock Hill, Summerville to the Lakelands.

Senate Democrats have finally made the right decision to end their political game and reopen the government — finding a permanent solution for Dreamers is an important but unrelated issue.

But we have a unique opportunity in front of us to extend #CHIP for longer than it has ever been extended since its creation, to make sure our Armed Forces have the support they need, and to keep the govt open. #SchumerShutdown Welcome to DC to all those South Carolinians and folks from across the country here for #MarchForLife! #ProLife Also Senate Democrats “have enough votes" to block the longest extension of CHIP since it was created. #Priorities … It was great to attend my first Senate Armed Services Committee  (@SASCMajority) hearing this morning.

There are obvious ways, such as the end of Jim Crow laws and the Civil Rights Act, but also ways we perhaps do not think about…ways your legacy has endured, even through tragedy. #ThankYouMLK50 But even though you were stolen from this world too young, your legacy endures. The change we have seen since you and my grandfather were born in the 1920s, not just in the South but across the country, has been massive. #ThankYouMLK50 Dr. King - I was just two years old when you were tragically killed in April 1968. You were born in the same decade as my grandfather, another black man born in the Jim Crow South. #ThankYouMLK50 The love & respect that Martin Luther King spoke about do not require absolute uniformity or watered-down viewpoints.
