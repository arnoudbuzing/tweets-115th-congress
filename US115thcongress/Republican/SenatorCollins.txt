I’m delighted that my bill to ban gag clauses that prevent pharmacists from telling patients how to pay the lowest possible price for medication is headed to the President’s desk for signature. This new law will help lower the cost of prescription drugs and save consumers money. The AG made the correct decision to recuse himself from the DOJ investigation into Russia’s attempts to interfere in our elections. The Deputy AG plays a critical role in overseeing the investigation headed by special counsel Mueller. I’m very concerned by reports that Deputy AG Rosenstein will either be fired or forced to resign. I hope that Dr. Ford will reconsider and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. It is my understanding that the Committee has offered to hold either a public or a private session, whichever would make her more comfortable. Read my full letter to the Chairman & Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee here:  pic.twitter.com/eALSEmPygN Such an approach would provide more continuity, elicit the most information & allow an in-depth examination of the allegations. I'm writing to the Chairman & RM of Judiciary Cmte respectfully recommending that at Monday’s hearing, counsel for Prof. Ford be allocated time to question Judge Kavanaugh & counsel for the Judge be granted equal time to question Prof. Ford, followed by questions from Senators. WATCH LIVE: Ahead of today’s vote, Senator Collins speaks from the Senate floor to urge her colleagues to support her bill to prohibit the use of “gag clauses,” an egregious practice that can conceal lower prescription drug prices from patients.  … Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee. What an honor to spend an evening with 38 of America’s heroes, recipients of the Medal of Honor, and their families & guests. Sec. Mattis, @JayLeno and Chris Wallace were recognized, and I was honored to receive the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Medal of Honor Society.pic.twitter.com/N0zrEJfupx 17 years ago, I joined my colleagues on the Capitol steps where we sang “God Bless America” in the wake of the terrorist attacks on our country. We gathered together in a demonstration of resolve & patriotism, not as Republicans & Democrats but as Americans. In what seemed like a moment, September 11th was transformed from a day like any other into one that, forever, will stand alone. The loss we relive reminds us of the value of all that we must protect. The heroism reminds us of the unconquerable spirit of the American people.pic.twitter.com/N99uByQ5Wl Spent a wonderful hour with President George H.W. Bush at his home in Kennebunkport yesterday. President Bush served his country faithfully and well. And how he loves the State of Maine! “We simply haven’t done enough” - @Jack agrees Twitter must do more to let you know if you’ve been targeted in a foreign influence operation. Much more must be done to protect users & our democracy.  WATCH LIVE: Senator Collins questions executives from Facebook and Twitter regarding their responses to foreign influence operations.  … I look forward to welcoming back to the Senate my friend Jon Kyl, who served Arizona so ably in the past and will do so once again now that Governor Ducey has appointed him to fill John McCain’s seat. On this Labor Day, I take special pride that the USS JOHN McCAIN was built by the world’s best shipbuilders at Bath Iron Works. Here’s BIW’s tribute to John & his family, which I shared w/ Cindy McCain who so appreciated it.  Tom & I are on our way to the memorial service for John McCain at the National Cathedral. Yesterday’s ceremony in the Rotunda was a moving tribute to John. Victory today for local newspapers! The ITC announced it will reverse the high import taxes it had levied on Canadian newsprint. Decision will help save jobs & ensure our newspapers can continue to have a strong voice in our communities.  … Each year, 200,000 children born in the U.S. are exposed to unsafe levels of mercury, which can lead to serious health issues. @SenatorCarper & I introduced a bill to help protect our nation’s health & environment by tracking mercury pollution.   WATCH: From the Senate floor, Senator Collins pays tribute to Senator John McCain.  … TUNE IN: I’ll be speaking with @MatthewGagnon and Joe Regan on @WGANMorningNews at 8:08 a.m.  Click here to listen live:  Senator John McCain is irreplaceable.

My husband Tom & I are praying for John McCain, Cindy, and their family. He is a great friend and a true American hero. WATCH LIVE: Senator Collins speaks from the floor about the urgent need to keep increasing funding for Alzheimer’s research. Robust funding for Alzheimer’s research will help us usher in a new era in our battle against this devastating disease.  … But Maine is also located at the end of our nation’s air pollution “tailpipe,” receiving pollution generated by power plants in other states. The Administration’s proposal to rewrite the national standards established by the Clean Power Plan is a step in the wrong direction. In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. And our state has made substantial progress in reducing carbon emissions, increasing energy efficiency, adopting clean energy technologies, & improving air quality & public health. WATCH LIVE: Senator Collins speaks from the Senate floor in support of the defense funding bill, which is vitally important to ensure our men & women in uniform, as well as DOD civilians, have the training & equipment they need to defend our nation.  … In a more than two-hour meeting in my office today, Judge Kavanaugh & I had a productive, informative discussion about a wide range of issues, including: his judicial philosophy, his respect for precedent, & the importance of an independent judiciary.  Read my statement here:pic.twitter.com/BSIRUlpfTv Employees of community banks & credit unions know their customers & are well-positioned to spot scams. That’s why I authored the Senior $afe Act to help improve training & encourage these workers to report financial exploitation, which costs seniors nearly $3 billion each year. When a local bank manager noticed unusual withdrawals on an account owned by Dawn Shaw, a retired legal secretary in Maine, she notified Dawn’s family & stopped this fraudulent activity. … .@SenatorCollins provided remarks via video for today's event at @ThomasCollege.

Jason is a shining example of the willingness of Maine people to help those in need, and we are so proud of his heroic actions. … The loss of Chris Cousins leaves a hole that will be felt by his family and friends, by his colleagues, and by his readers who relied on Chris’ insightful reporting. This touching tribute encapsulates the wonderful man he was. … .@PewTrusts is an amazing partner in our effort to combat rising drug costs.  I had the pleasure of giving a speech at PEW recently about the work we’re doing in Congress to help ensure that lifesaving Rx drugs are affordable for all Americans. Listen here. … After 11-year-old Destany had a cancerous brain tumor removed, she & her friend CC opened a lemonade stand in Lewiston to benefit @BBCHMaine & St. Mary’s Hospital, raising nearly $2,000!  I wrote to these girls to let them know how proud I am of their hard work to help others. … Who would think that using your debit card to pay for Rx drugs would be less expensive than using your insurance card?  You have a right to know when you can get your medications cheaper.  Read my @bangordailynews column on an egregious practice that could be costing you money. … The movie Hidden Figures tells the stories of the brilliant African-American women who played a pivotal role at @NASA during the Space Race. I recently signed onto a bill to award these amazing women Congressional Gold Medals.  … The U.S. faces an enormous backlog of necessary infrastructure repairs.

Maine’s maple syrup & honey producers could be harmed by a proposed FDA rule that would require them to put an “added sugar” label on their products. Today, the Senate passed my amendment to protect family-owned business by blocking this misguided rule.  … If you receive a suspicious solicitation online or on the phone, call the @SenateAging Committee Fraud Hotline at 1-855-303-9470 (2/2) A good reminder from @patrickdempsey.

I voted against his nomination because it was clear he did not support the EPA’s mission. As it turned out, that was only part of the problem.
