In interview, he accuses "game playing" by "majority party" with regards her testimony.

This is not consistent with Brett."  #TheStory  pic.twitter.com/kiDCVaaobN 1) Important: Sources tell me that Senate Judiciary staff have now asked Deborah Ramirez, through her attorneys, to provide a statement or any corroborating evidence on five separate occasions.
