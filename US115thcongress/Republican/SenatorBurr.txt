If you take away one thing about the #LWCF, it should be this: it costs ZERO taxpayer money. #SaveLWCF  I’ll be speaking on the Senate floor this afternoon with Senator @SteveDaines and @SenCoryGardner about the importance of #LWCF. You can watch live here:   My statement on Judge Kavanaugh:pic.twitter.com/WyLzJucmF5 At no cost to the American taxpayer, #LWCF preserves public lands across the country and in nearly every congressional district. This is a no-brainer - we need to renew this vital program before it expires on Sept. 30. #SaveLWCF Thank you to the incredible men and women of our armed forces who didn't hesitate to come to the aid of their neighbors and friends in #HurricaneFlorence's wake. Without them, the damage and lives lost could’ve been so much worse. @FtBraggNC @Camp_Lejeune … Army Pfc. William H. Jones of Nash County, one of North Carolina’s sons MIA from the Korean War, was among the heroes recently returned to the United States. We welcome him home and owe him and his family a debt of gratitude for his service. #POWMIADay … Tomorrow @NatlParkService hosts the 25th Annual #NationalPublicLandsDay, offering free admission at all national parks across the country.

Not just because it preserves our beautiful outdoors for the next generation, but because it helps protect our communities today. #SaveLWCF After #HurricaneSandy, wetlands like the LWCF-funded Cape May National Wildlife Refuge in New Jersey saved an estimated $650 million in damages. #LWCF funds create beautiful spaces that double as critical infrastructure. #SaveLWCF For instance, the natural green spaces and parks that wind through Charlotte aren't just there for their looks. The Four Mile Creek Greenway also absorbs rain drainage, slowing it down and doubling as a flood control. #SaveLWCF North Carolinians have more on their minds today than recreation, as we contend with the terrible damage inflicted by #HurricaneFlorence. But #LWCF is critical for building the infrastructure communities need to minimize floods and heavy rains. #SaveLWCF With just 12 days left before the Land and Water Conservation Fund expires, I am as committed as ever to making sure Congress reauthorizes America's most successful conservation program. #SaveLWCF #IRS has extended tax filing deadlines for victims of #HurricaneFlorence in key counties.

We’ve identified the problem - now it’s time to identify the solution. Read my full opening statement here:  … I am disappointed that @Google’s  senior leadership chose not to be a part of today’s hearing. Our discussion will be a productive one and will help determine how we address a serious national security risk. HAPPENING NOW: Senate Intel Committee hears from @Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and @Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on foreign influence operations' use of social media platforms. Watch here live:  … Today @ 9:30am, the Senate Intel Committee will hear from @Facebook & @Twitter execs on social media platforms' use in foreign influence operations. You can watch it live here   … The economy grew at 4.2 percent last quarter - the best in nearly four years. There's no doubt that the #TaxCutsandJobsAct continues to benefit millions of Americans and spur economic growth. … I am glad the Senate has finally confirmed Isabel Patelunas as the @USTreasury’s new Asst. Secretary for Intelligence & Analysis. As America faces new and growing threats, it is critical that our intelligence positions are fully staffed with capable and qualified public servants. John will be remembered as he hoped to be remembered: as a man who served his country with honor. Brooke and send our prayers to Cindy and the entire McCain family.  … I am deeply saddened by the passing of my friend and colleague, John McCain. John was a true patriot, who placed his duty to his family and his country above all else. He faced this battle with the courage that defined his career and the grace that comes from a life well-lived. I said I’d go down to the Senate floor every day until Congress acts to #SaveLWCF - and I’m keeping that promise. You can watch live here:  … … Here’s my promise to my colleagues: I’ll keep demanding a vote on the Senate floor - day after day - until we do what the American people want and #SaveLWCF. #LWCF has support from Republicans and Democrats, in the Senate and in the House. Americans support the program and want it to continue. Yet for some reason, the Senate still refuses to take up this issue. Conservation programs, like #LWCF, plan generations ahead and need security to do their work effectively. This solution provides that, while ensuring Congress is still in the driver’s seat. This bill is a bipartisan compromise. It would permanently reauthorize #LWCF, but give Congress the chance to hold a vote of disapproval every 3 years. If the disapproval vote passes, it ends authorization. Today, I asked the Senate to take up a bill to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund before it expires next month. #LWCF is critical for preserving our national parks and waters for future generations - and uses NO taxpayer funds.  WATCH: Senator Burr Live on Senate Floor Pushing for #LWCF Vote  … Senator @MarkWarner and I released the following statement today on Michael Cohen’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee:pic.twitter.com/0UyEP21qkI My statement on former @CIA Director John Brennan’s recent comments:  … "People with disabilities in America are still extraordinarily underemployed and more likely to be out of the workforce" write @SenatorBurr & @SenBobCasey for @CNNopinion  .@SenBobCasey and I wrote this weekend about how we can get more Americans with disabilities working.

Enough is enough. We need to protect veterans and others with disabilities and their fellow passengers at the same time. … The @HBCUCaucus #DiversityInTech Summit aims to improve recruitment and retention of #HBCU graduates looking to enter tech.
