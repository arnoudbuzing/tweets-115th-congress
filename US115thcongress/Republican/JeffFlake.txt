I will speak about tomorrow’s hearing on the Senate Floor at 1:15pm One of life’s great dayspic.twitter.com/MsQr8ERvFx Your sources are not accurate.

No one should make light of this situation.pic.twitter.com/G7rlT3IKTQ When Dr. Ford came forward, I said that her voice should be heard and asked the Judiciary Committee to delay its vote on Judge Kavanaugh. It did so. I now implore Dr. Ford to accept the invitation for Monday, in a public or private setting. The committee should hear her voice. Speaking on the senate floor momentarily on the importance of AG Jeff Sessions holding his job and continuing to assert independence when the President asks him to protect his friends and go after his enemies Remembering those who lost their lives on 9/11, and those who have given their all to keep us safe ever since. So happy to have Senator Kyl back in familiar surroundings.pic.twitter.com/ym0dGapGQl Governor Ducey has selected Senator Jon Kyl as Senator McCain’s replacement. What an excellent choice! There is no one more qualified and Arizona is well served. Kudos to Senator Kyl for his willingness to serve once again. This is not the conduct of a President committed to defending and upholding the constitution, but rather a President looking to use the Department of Justice to settle political scores. … I watched them lay my friend to rest today.

The world has lost a hero and a statesman. Cindy and the McCain family have lost a loving husband and father. I have lost a wonderful friend. God bless and keep this wonderful man and his family @SenJohnMcCain There's a danger in conducting foreign policy by tweet after viewing a single press report. First, land reforms have been proposed in parliament in South Africa, but not yet adopted. Second, there is no "large scale killing of farmers" going on in South Africa. … Pleased to cosponsor this amendment. Granting/revoking security clearances should not be a political exercise. … This kind of language is unbecoming of a President of the United States. There is no excuse for it, and Republicans should not be okay with it. … I am grateful, as are my colleagues and the country, for @SenJohnMcCain's enduring commitment to our national defense. … Good meeting today with Botswana’s President Masisi ⁦@OfficialMasisi⁩.

I write about it on Medium, under the title "What's right with America" … Speaking on Senate floor in just a couple of minutes on bipartisan resolution regarding Helsinki Summit The Russian ambassador says that "important verbal agreements" were reached at the Helsinki summit.  What are those commitments, Mr. President? Congress needs to know. Just intro’d a resolution with @ChrisCoons reaffirming Senate support for the Intel Community’s assessment of Russian attacks and dismissing the denial of Vladimir Putin. Tomorrow on the Senate floor we will ask for unanimous consent to pass it.    … What am I doing, this pig can’t even read.pic.twitter.com/Bi3PEAG25S I never thought I would see the day when our American President would stand on the stage with the Russian President and place blame on the United States for Russian aggression. This is shameful. Mr. President, as today’s indictments reaffirm, election interference is not a question to be asked of Vladimir Putin, but a statement to be made to Vladimir Putin: You interfered in our elections. My thoughts on the upcoming meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin … At approximate 2:00pm EDT I will deliver a senate floor speech titled Friends, Foes & Peace When we were attacked on 9/11, our NATO allies rushed to our defense. They have remained stedfast ever since, sacrificing thousands of lives in Afghanistan over these many years to keep us safe. I hope they know how much we appreciate their commitment and friendship. By a vote of 88-11, the senate just took the first step to rein in the President’s abuse of trade authority by using national security as justification to levy tariffs. FINALLY, Senate will push back on the President’s abuse of Section 232 to impose tariffs. We will vote Wednesday on a “Motion to Instruct,” a first step toward reasserting Congress’s constitutional role on tariffs. Again, nobody wins trade wars … Our bipartisan, bicameral delegation was greeted warmly by Finland’s President in Turku this morning with homegrown rhubarb juice.

When we confront China on unfair trade practices, we need our allies, especially those in the EU, with us, not against us. … This story is going to be played out all over the country. Nobody wins trade wars. … I just published “Travel Ban” … Decency wins. … Trade wars are not won, only lost. … Left or right, nobody deserves this kind of treatment. … "Tender Age" shelters for toddlers?

But to suggest that she might have avoided being shot had she carried a weapon as she spoke to constituents that morning is inappropriate and inconsiderate. … In June my boss was shot at in #Alexandria. In November my sister was shot at in #LasVegas. Today my new coworkers were shot at in #SanBruno. And I'm sure there are others with similar stories. The feeling that this is somehow the new normal is just heartbreaking. To say that "Democrats want no borders" is inaccurate. Every senate Democrat voted for bipartisan immigration legislation in 2013 that included $40+ billion for border infrastructure, personnel & technology. Both sides of the aisle want reform. Let's do it. There are plenty of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who stand ready to work with the administration on legislation to protect DACA kids who call America home. Let's do it.
