Further, the bill would support programs required to protect vital national security interests. #FundingOurDefense The appropriations bill currently on the floor makes good on @POTUS’s promise to rebuild America’s military. This bill would provide an additional $16M above the FY18 enacted level, which was the largest increase for the Pentagon in 15 yrs. #FundingOurDefense This week the Senate is continuing to work in a #bipartisan manner to pass the 8th & 9th FY2019 funding bills this year!

This is a critical step in providing private anglers more days to fish on the water. .@ExxonMobil has announced it will invest $50 billion in the US. Encouraged to see yet another example of how #taxreform is resulting in more jobs and economic investment in our great country.  Thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the train crash today.

I am encouraged by his stated plans to work with Congress, delivering on our promises & further strengthening our great nation. #SOTU … Looking forward to hearing from @POTUS this evening as he gives an update on the state of the union, outlines upcoming priorities, and discusses the many Republican accomplishments from 2017. #taxreform #circuitcourtnoms #economicgrowth #veterans #strongnationaldefense #SOTU It is disappointing that many of my Senate colleagues did not support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. As a cosponsor of the bill, I will continue to fight for #prolife values. #TheyFeelPain Tonight I will vote to advance legislation that protects children by banning elective abortions after 20 weeks (5 months), an age at which babies have the potential to thrive and live normal lives. I urge my colleagues to pass this and choose life. #TheyFeelPain Wrapped up my weekend of county visits by stopping in #MarengoCounty.

I look forward to getting back to unfinished business such as a budget agreement, military funding, disaster relief, and border security. Relieved that Senate Democrats finally chose to leave partisan politics at the door and join Republicans in our work to fund the government, reauthorize CHIP, and continue negotiating other issues. Congress can soon get back to ongoing conversations regarding important policy. It is unacceptable that Democrats would vote against funding our government, funding our troops, and funding CHIP, only to cause a government shutdown over illegal immigration. The American people deserve better.   #SchumerShutdown Great to see so many Alabamians in Washington for the @March_for_Life, working to help protect the unborn's right to life. #WhyWeMarch #MarchForLife Today I congratulated the @UofAlabama Crimson Tide on the Senate floor and introduced a resolution commending their victory in the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship Game. #RollTide @AlabamaFTBL  pic.twitter.com/jzRRcRRLOr In Alabama, 150,000 kids are depending on the Child Health Insurance Program.
