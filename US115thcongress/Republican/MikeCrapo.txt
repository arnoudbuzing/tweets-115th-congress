It was the product of hard work by Chairman @MikeCrapo and the Banking Committee, and I was proud to support it. Today, @POTUS signed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief & Consumer Protection Act into law. This rolls back #DoddFrank, delivering much-needed relief for hard-working Americans & small businesses. Thanks @MikeCrapo & @RepHensarling for your hard work on this important issue. Great news!

Today's Senate passage of the #VAMISSIONAct signals to our nation's veterans we will continue to ensure they receive the care they have earned.

Sen. Crapo’s bill is an important first step in fully repealing Dodd-Frank. It will spark more investment & growth, in #Idaho & America. For years, the Obama-era Dodd-Frank rules designed for Wall Street made life needlessly difficult for lenders on Main Street. But today, we’re one step closer to delivering relief. My statement on House passage of Chairman @MikeCrapo’s reforms to Dodd-Frank:pic.twitter.com/NF67u8orYk This step toward right-sizing regulation will allow local banks and credit unions to focus more on lending, in turn propelling economic growth and creating jobs on Main Street and in our communities. #Relief4MainStreet The House just passed S. 2155, bipartisan banking legislation that has been years in the making.
