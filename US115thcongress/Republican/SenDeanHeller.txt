A state without a single nuclear power plant should not have to shoulder the entire nation’s nuclear burden.  … Proud to see that the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, & Military Construction & Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act has passed the U.S. House of Representatives with my provisions to support Nevada’s veterans and strengthen our water supply and security. No veteran in Nevada should have to fight long waits for a mental health appointment. While Congress has made welcome progress on the issue of reducing veteran suicide, more must be done. Learn about my VA Hiring Enhancement Act here:  … Nevada has one of the highest rates of veteran suicide in the country. That is why I'm urging my colleagues to support my legislation that will help provide supportive mental health services to our military heroes fighting invisible injuries. #NationalSuicidePreventionWeek "Renewing @BrandUSA long-term is important for the economy, as well as the perfect opportunity for bipartisan cooperation." - @RoyBlunt and @SenDeanHeller  Pleased to announce that @UMCSN and the #SouthernNevada Health District have been awarded a total of $300,000 from @HHSGov.

Learn more:  … The cost of providing the care and benefits we owe to our veterans for their service & sacrifices should not be part of any reasoning to reject legislation that extends disability benefits to our Blue Water Navy veterans exposed to Agent Orange.

Thank you to all of Nevada's  veterans for your service and sacrifice.pic.twitter.com/yntn6DuGFS Once again, the U.S. House of Representatives has failed in its relentless pursuit to turn #NV into our nation’s nuclear waste dump. Read about my work to keep funding to revive #YuccaMountain out of the reconciled appropriations bill released today:  … I cosponsored the #STARAct to accelerate pediatric cancer research & provide resources to young patients. It's a positive step toward supporting survivors & helping our nation’s top disease fighters develop treatments to save young lives.

Read more here:  … Not only does shipping up to one metric ton of plutonium across the country likely present risks to those living along the proposed transportation routes, storing this material just a few miles from #LasVegas could threaten the health & safety of Nevadans & our tourism economy. DOE should not move forward with its proposal to store weapons-grade plutonium in #Nevada before fully evaluating the health, safety, and environmental impact that it would have on our state.

That’s what this new tax law is all about, & it’s why I fought to see that Nevadans keep more of their hard-earned money. In addition to helping w/ day-to-day costs, the increased #ChildTaxCredit allows families to better plan their futures. For example, Sarah, a single mom living in #NV, used her tax credit to help her & her four children move out of a family shelter & pay rent a year in advance. As a member of @GOPSenFinance who helped craft the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, I was proud to author the provision that doubled the child tax credit, or increase it from $1,000 to $2,000. This could mean more money to help cover for groceries, school supplies, or diapers.pic.twitter.com/Jfle1jlbWL Today is #NationalTaxFilingDay & it’s the last time #Nevadans will have to file taxes under the old, broken system. It’s only been a few months since the #TaxCutsandJobsAct became law, & #Nevadans are already benefiting from bigger paychecks, special bonuses & increased benefits.

This bill provides mental health treatment to veterans who may not have access to VA benefits.   #NV law enforcement is facing a nearly $2.8 million shortfall due to overtime costs following the Oct. 1st tragedy in #LasVegas. That’s why I fought for additional funding to help compensate these men and women for their service.

(2/2) Read my full stmt here:   It’s about time that Democrats came to their senses and made the decision to end their political games that led to the #SchumerShutdown. (1/2) I'm disappointed that my colleagues across the aisle chose the route of not working on appropriations bills and shutting down the government. More from my speech on the Senate floor during the #SchumerShutdown here:  … VIDEO: I'm frustrated that Congress once again failed to do its job and now #Nevadans are left with the #SchumerShutdown.

If Congress doesn't do its job, we shouldn't get paid.  … Once again, Washington has lost its mind. It’s shameful what Democrats are doing; an engineered government shutdown at the expense of our troops & their families, our vets & our nation’s most vulnerable children.   #SchumerShutdown Let's not forget how Congress got to this point; Democrats have prevented appropriations bills from receiving a vote, which is why we are in this position today. That’s why I have repeatedly introduced my #NoBudgetNoPay bill. Don't shut down the government, do your job. Interesting. @SenateDems call me, I’ve had 2 bills out for months. #NoBudgetNoPay says if Congress can't do its job, we won't get paid. My #EnsuringPayforOurMilitaryAct guarantees troops get paid during a shutdown. Would like to add more members to both! … Why are Democrats who are engineering a government shutdown talking about the need for Congress to do its job? I have repeatedly introduced #NoBudgetNoPay to make sure of it. Shutting down the government hurts our troops and our vets. Of course Congress shouldn't get paid. Rep. Scott Perry's recent comments on the Oct. 1st shooting in Las Vegas are inexcusable. I applaud Sheriff Lombardo's leadership and I fully support our local law enforcement who have been working tirelessly on this investigation. If @SenateDems shut down the government, our troops will not get paid & #vets will lose too. Too many vets, service members & their families are already living paycheck to paycheck. An engineered shut down by @SenateDems is indefensible & politics at its worst. #SchumerShutdown .@SenateDems support #CHIP & delaying #Obamacare's ill-conceived #HealthInsuranceTax & #CadillacTax. In fact, my bipartisan measure to permanently repeal the #CadillacTax passed 90-10. So even though Dems support what's in the bill, they're still on board w/the #SchumerShutdown In addition to funding the Children's Health Insurance Program, this bill delays #Obamacare’s #CadillacTax, which would hurt more than 1 million #Nevadans alone, and the #HealthInsuranceTax in order to prevent Americans from paying even more for their health care #SchumerShutdown #CHIP serves as a lifeline for thousands of children in #Nevada. If @SenateDems shut down the government today, they are choosing partisanship over continued health care coverage for America’s vulnerable kids and their families. #SchumerShutdown Glenna on my staff was at @RenoAirport to welcome Col. Donald “Doc” Ballard to #Nevada! Col. Ballard earned the Medal of Honor for his heroism during the #VietnamWar.pic.twitter.com/WlWV8hqkKA Introduced a bipartisan bill today to modernize rules for business development companies, lenders that are critical to helping #Nevada's #smallbusinesses grow.

We've already seen its positive impact w/companies announcing bonuses & wage increases. Today is a good day for Nevadans & Americans everywhere   From bringing @stevenmnuchin1 to #NV to hear directly from my constituents to working w/@IvankaTrump to increase the #childtaxcredit, I made sure that Nevadans voices were heard by the Administration & my colleagues as we worked to put together & pass this #taxrelief bill. This is particularly important at a time when nearly 8 in 10 Americans who work full-time live paycheck to paycheck. Nevadans have been waiting for a break, and this is it. For example, this #taxrelief bill includes my and @SenatorTimScott provision to double the #childtaxcredit. I encourage all #Nevadans to compare your paychecks today to the ones you'll receive in February; they're going to be bigger because our bill allows you to keep more of your hard-earned money. I applaud @SecretaryZinke for initiating a review of the outdated, job-crushing policies that inhibit our ability to utilize our own mineral resources.

Looking forward to @POTUS signing this bill. It was an honor to join @POTUS, @VP & my colleagues today at the White House to highlight this once-in-a-generation #taxrelief bill that will give hardworking families in #Nevada the #taxcuts that they’ve been waiting for. Read more:   The U.S. House just voted to send the #TaxCutsandJobsAct to @POTUS’s desk. I look forward to joining the President and my colleagues at the White House this afternoon. Read more about the legislation and how it helps #Nevada here:   In Case You Missed It: I joined my colleagues on @GOPSenFinance following Senate passage of the historic #TaxCutsandJobsAct, a once-in-a-generation bill that will deliver #taxrelief for hardworking Nevadans. Watch here:   This bill is about empowering middle-class families and restoring their faith in the American dream, and I look forward to seeing this legislation sent to the President’s desk later this week.  … As a member of the tax-writing @GOPSenFinance Committee, I thank Chairman @senorrinhatch for his leadership and I’m incredibly proud of our work to move tax reform legislation for the first time in more than 30 years. From doubling the child tax credit to lowering rates on middle-class families, our legislation finally gives Nevadans the break that they deserve by allowing them to keep more of their paychecks.  … Whether it’s the single mother in Gardnerville who works full-time or the ambitious entrepreneur in Reno who started a business while going to school, Nevadans throughout the state will benefit from the passage of this historic legislation.  … I know how important it is for #Nevadans to be able to keep more of their paychecks. That’s why I have been fighting - and will continue to fight - to get this bill to the President’s desk. If you're against this bill, you're against #taxcuts for the middle class because that's what this bill is all about. And if you know that nearly 1/3 of Americans don’t have $500 to cover an emergency expense, then you know how important a few hundred extra dollars are to them. If you're against this bill, you're against giving #smallbiz the chance to actually get off the ground and hire workers. You’re against giving them a better opportunity to expand, invest, increase wages, and do what they do best: create jobs. If you're against this bill, you're satisfied with the anemic 2% growth ushered in by the Obama Administration & accept it as the new normal. But I'll never accept it because I know we can do better. We already have seen our economy improve since @POTUS took office.
