Because of the #TaxReform law American businesses competing globally now have a competitive advantage & are more likely to invest here in American workers. In fact we’re seeing it already  It used to be that U.S. companies made money overseas, paid taxes abroad, and if they wanted to bring money back home that had to pay a tax twice. That led to businesses keeping $2.8 trillion overseas rather than investing in the American economy. #TaxReform changed that.pic.twitter.com/BfcozYDBnu By moving the U.S. to a “territorial” tax system & lowering the corporate rate to 21% (under the new #TaxReform law) businesses have incentive to bring foreign profits back to the U.S. and invest in American #jobs  pic.twitter.com/7dS2ZVu5Np The Sanders plan would get rid of the #MedicareAdvantage plans that more than 17 million seniors have today. #AARP Remember when President Obama promised that if people liked their insurance they could keep their insurance?

Answer: EVERYONE with private coverage. Now we can get back to focusing on properly funding our military, spending caps and finding a solution for immigration.   We also extended the Children’s Health Insurance Program for 6 years. As a doctor, I know how valuable this program is for more than 7,000 children in Wyoming. Senate Democrats finally realized that their pointless shutdown failed to do anything but inflict unnecessary pain on Americans. Voting to reopen the government was the right thing to do.   I voted today to fund our military & extend CHIP 6 yrs for #Wyo families. It’s irresponsible that some are seeking this shutdown over their agenda on illegal immigration.

Smith Act, which will increase the safety of roads throughout Indian Country.   “We are unified in our effort to keep our promises. To lower rates. To simplify the tax system. And to focus on an American economy bringing jobs home. Something that is good for families, and main street.” … Families ought to be able to make decisions about what they want to buy & what works for them–not the government. I believe if people don’t want to buy #Obamacare insurance, they shouldn’t have to pay a tax penalty to the IRS.   Under the Senate #TaxReform plan, people would no longer have to pay #Obamacare tax penalty if they don’t want, or can’t afford, expensive health insurance. … Today, the @POTUS met with Senate Republicans to discuss the #TaxReformBill.

Looking forward to joining @cvpayne on @TeamCavuto @FOXBusiness at 1:20 pm ET to talk about #SCOTUS ruling on president’s executive amnesty. Meeting today with @SenJohnBarrasso about music education. #nafmehd16 @nafme @CourtneyCasnerd #musiceducationpic.twitter.com/nKkc62e1v9 We cannot afford to reward those who are coming here illegally—court was right in putting an end to this outrageous executive overreach. Supreme Court just shut the door on the president’s executive amnesty program.   #USvTX Barrasso, Enzi Pleased With Fracking Ruling  … Thank you @SenJohnBarrasso for the conversation today on #ESSA and #CarlPerkins funding #nasspdcpic.twitter.com/2LwqaEAYql Here's why surgeon and senator @SenJohnBarrasso says Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced. #healthreform … Judge Skavdahl’s ruling should be upheld—Wyo & other energy states—not Washington—are best prepared to regulate oil & natural gas production US District Court struck down BLM’s fracking rule—encouraging to see federal court state limits of president’s power   Live now: @SenJohnBarrasso @SenJohnThune @RepKristiNoem and I at Indian Affairs hearing.  pic.twitter.com/sfMFTzLiaV
