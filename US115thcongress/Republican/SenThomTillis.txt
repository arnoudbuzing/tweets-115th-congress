Southeast Region #CyberSecurity & Technology Symposium.  October 11, 2018 - Chapel Hill.  @SenatorBurr @SenThomTillis @NCMBC  pic.twitter.com/33ItT6Gj64 Appreciated the opportunity to join the @SecArmy this morning to discuss @USArmy readiness and modernization - two key pillars for the continued growth and sustainment of the most lethal and dedicated Army in the world. … If Turkey is going to behave this way and not treat us with the respect I think you should treat another NATO ally, then we have to rethink our relationship. I'll do everything I can to make Turkey accountable for the unlawful detention of Pastor Brunson. #FreePastorBrunsonpic.twitter.com/jg29pnLFm6 To prioritize timely adjudication of family cases, this legislation authorizes 225 new immigration judges and requires the Sec of Homeland Security and Attorney General to prioritize resolving cases of children & families in family residential centers.  …pic.twitter.com/dCUTRD4LQK The Keep Families Together and Enforce the Law Act clarifies federal law to ensure that families will remain together and receive good care as they go through the legal process.  …pic.twitter.com/xvnkFaBw4F We will not forget about Pastor Andrew Brunson. #FreePastorBrunsonpic.twitter.com/bNMdAtBRuu Yesterday, I introduced the Keep Families Together and Enforce the Law Act that ensures children and parents receive fair and humane treatment and stay together during legal proceedings. #KeepFamiliesTogether  Turkey's duty as a NATO ally is to respect the due process rights of US citizens traveling or residing in Turkey. Until this applies to Pastor Brunson's case, the United States should rethink our relationship with Turkey. #FreePastorBrunson …  “Keep Families Together and Enforce the Law Act” … Robert will be a great VA Secretary, and I look forward to getting him confirmed. … While the President’s executive order was a necessary step, Congress still needs to take action to make our laws clear and consistent so children are not separated from their families in the future. The legislation I just introduced with my colleagues prevents family separation. The Keep Families Together and Enforce the Law Act ensures children and parents receive fair and humane treatment and stay together during legal proceedings. I just introduced legislation that will keep families together and ensure the integrity of our nation’s immigration laws. #KeepFamiliesTogether … Great to meet Student Spotlight recipients from @VanceCoSchools today. Enjoy your visit to DC!pic.twitter.com/ITBxaydn89 I am also pleased my bipartisan provision with @SenatorShaheen to delay the sale of F-35s to Turkey was included so we can send a clear message to President Erdogan that the United States expects Turkey to uphold its obligations as a NATO ally. The Senate passage of the NDAA is a testament to our commitment to rebuild the military and ensure our men and women in uniform have the resources and support they need to protect our nation. … Good luck at the #CWS, @DiamondHeels! #GoHeels … My op-ed via @thehill on Pastor Brunson and our relationship with Turkey. #FreePastorBrunson … I believe we can strike the right balance between being compassionate—especially towards children who were brought here through no fault of their own—and also being smart by taking steps needed to prevent future illegal immigration. (3/3) Our nation is long-overdue for commonsense immigration reform, particularly when it comes to providing a path to naturalization for DACA recipients and securing our borders. (2/3) We should not be separating children migrants from their families. Congress can take action to provide better long-term certainty and consistency on this issue in a way that does not incentivize unauthorized border crossings. (1/3) Wishing all dads a Happy #FathersDay!pic.twitter.com/M2LS7YfbSV I had the honor of attending the #PatriotPier Dedication at Ramsey Creek Park in Cornelius.

I’m pleased my provisions to improve payment processing and authorize new pilot programs to modernize the VA were included. Today is a step in the right direction to modernize the VA and implement commonsense solutions to deliver on the VA’s mission of providing veterans with the best healthcare, resources, and support possible. #VAMISSIONAct … Thanks to @SenThomTillis for meeting, and to @NC_TNC trustees for using their #VoicesForNature to talk #conservation of the state's lands and waters. … 269 North Carolinians now rest in peace at the American Cemetery in Normandy.

Join me in taking a moment to think about those men and women and also thank a veteran or someone currently serving for their service.pic.twitter.com/zxZ3fee748 In the #NDAA, we need to send a clear message to President Erdogan & the people of Turkey to treat Americans fairly and with respect. If they don't, we're going to have to continue to up the temperature until justice is done for Pastor Brunson and others in Turkish prisons. (2/2) I spoke on the Senate floor on Pastor Andrew Brunson, who has been wrongfully imprisoned by the Turkish Government for 594 days. #FreePastorBrunson (1/2)  I applaud Congress for coming together on a #bipartisan basis to pass the VA MISSION Act and follow through on the promises we made to those who served our country.

I want to replicate these results on the federal level. Although the bill is not perfect, I look forward to working with my colleagues to modernize our criminal justice system to reduce recidivism and promote public safety. #CJReform I voted for the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, bipartisan legislation that increases access to recidivism reduction programs & helps prisoners successfully re-enter society & narrows some mandatory minimum sentences to focus on violent offenders & serious drug offenders. It’s clear the only path forward to providing a permanent solution for #DACA, securing our borders & modernizing our immigration system is building consensus on a plan @POTUS supports & can be signed into law. I’ll continue to work on both sides of the aisle to reach consensus. The Schumer-Rounds-Collins plan is well-meaning but has serious flaws. For example on pg 64, it says our immigration laws should not be enforced for any new illegal aliens who are here or who entered the U.S. in the next 4 months, until June 30, until they commit a serious crime.pic.twitter.com/BYLzwW7VEX We must protect DACA youth and secure our borders, and the Secure & Succeed Act is the only bill that can become law. Schumer-Rounds-Collins is well-intentioned but falls drastically short of being a proposal that can get a vote in the House and be signed into law.

I hope all of the students have a great time! You can watch them at 3pm ET on Saturday in the Battle of the Bands: … Two weeks ago, a bipartisan group in Congress agreed with the President to enact immigration reform addressing four main topics. After reviewing proposals from Republicans & Democrats, POTUS today released a common-sense compromise. Now it’s time for Congress to get to work. The Dream Act has come up 3x’s in Congress in the last decade. It has failed every time, including when Dems controlled WH & Congress.  To those who are truly serious about finding a DACA solution, it’s time to move past the Dream Act & discuss other options. We only have 14 days Looks like both @SenTomCotton & @sendavidperdue are on board with the WH immigration proposal:pic.twitter.com/58kw98nXpe Sen.

It's time to move forward and continue discussions for DACA/Border Security. We have been talking for months about ways to address Congress’ unfinished business — military spending, disaster relief, healthcare, immigration, and border security.  Now those talks can get going again. Once the government reopens those conversations can and will speed up. But it is imperative that Congress comes together to find solutions in a way that doesn’t jeopardize military, children’s healthcare, and important gov’t functions. UPDATE: Gov’t shutdown will continue into Day 3. Senate will vote on a CR to reopen the gov’t midday Monday. Responsible governing requires working together & finding common ground. There are substantive immigration conversations happening that will solve DACA & border issues. The only way the #SchumerShutdown will end is if my Democratic colleagues come to their senses and stop trying to score political points at the expense of the American people: our servicemembers, veterans and 9 million kids relying on #CHIP.pic.twitter.com/xY6vhh8tyx The #SchumerShutdown Clock … Tonight, the Senate Democrats forced a shutdown of the federal government, putting partisan politics over our servicemembers, veterans and kids relying on CHIP.
