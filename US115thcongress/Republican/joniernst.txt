You have my word. My commitment to you remains the same, however. We MUST continue to work for those who have been negatively impacted by ObamaCare. And to say I’m disappointed that my colleagues in the Senate chose this unsustainable status quo would be an understatement. Unfortunately, all three of those votes failed. Over the last few days, I’ve voted three times to repeal ObamaCare, just like I promised you. We can’t give up. In the days ahead, as the Senate moves forward and considers various options, I will continue to make your voice heard in Washington. That’s why I voted to begin debate on repealing this disastrous law and replacing it with solutions that are patient-centered. For far too long, I’ve heard from folks about the struggles everyday Americans face under ObamaCare. Wishing my friend, and American hero, John McCain the very best.

Join me this March at National Harbor! The House just passed my bill to stop the Obama Administration’s latest land-grab – the EPA’s expanded Waters of the U.S. Rule. We need a leader to get America growing again, develop plans to destroy ISIS & ensure we remain a strong, stabilizing force around the globe In 2016 we need to elect a strong conservative leader to the White House. Last night's #SOTU was another campaign speech long on rhetoric and short on real solutions. Today I voted in support of a bi-partisan initiative to audit the Federal Reserve because Iowans deserve transparency. So excited to have another outstanding conservative woman in a position of leadership in Iowa. Congrats @SpeakerUpmeyer!

Sen Grassley and I responded. … Wishing the very best for my good friend @ddkochel who will fight and BEAT leukemia! Our thoughts and prayers are with you. I intro’d a bill to eliminate expanded WOTUS. Today's court ruling to put it on hold reminds us why stopping it is important to IA farmers. Veterans deserve quality healthcare. I intro’d the VETS Act to create more affordable & accessible care for IA vets.  Today the Senate passed the NDAA.  President Obama is threatening a veto, but I’m voting to support our troops.
