Tricia will always be remembered as a #NEHero. Full video here:pic.twitter.com/4LUKhw3Cxa @SenatorFischer signed to co-sponsor the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act Monday! We are heading to the #alzforum in D.C. with real momentum! Thank you Alzheimer's @SenatorFischer and Alzheimer's advocates!  … Sergeant First Class Tricia Jameson loved her family, she embodied the pride of her state and the values of our nation. #NEHeroes #Service  For her service to our nation, Sergeant First Class Tricia Jameson earned many military decorations, including the Purple Heart and Bronze Star posthumously. #NEHeroes #Service Sgt. Jameson’s name and reputation live on as soldiers save lives, just as she did, on the battlefield. Without hesitation, Sgt. Jameson answered the call. She was speeding towards the battlefield to attend to the fallen when her field ambulance was struck by an IED. That day, she gave her life while serving her country. Sgt. Jameson and her battle buddy, Specialist Rachelle Spors received an urgent call to help injured Marines in combat a few miles from where they were. By June of 2005, Sgt. Jameson was in Iraq on duty with the 313th Medical Company at Camp Speicher. Jameson’s first mission on the road was a long one. She was the vehicle commander of an M997 ambulance that was headed to Trebil near the Jordan border. With her determination, she raised that program into a world-class operation. The soldiers who took her program went on to save lives around the world. As combat intensified in #Afghanistan and #Iraq, Tricia was tasked with improving the Combat Life Saver course, which teaches soldiers basic medical skills for the battlefield. After high school, Tricia joined the @NENationalGuard in 1994. With her grit and determination, she soon was promoted to become a full-time training instructor at Camp Ashland. Tricia grew up in the farm country of St. Paul, NE, and at a young age, she advocated for what is right and how others should be treated. Each Nebraska hero has a powerful story, and today, I’m honoring the life of @NENationalGuard Sergeant First Class Tricia Jameson.  SOON: Watch as I speak on the #SenateFloor to honor a #NebraskaHero Sergeant First Class Tricia Jameson.

Lonnie Calvin Allen, Jr. Scholarship. Sergeant Allen’s memorial service was held at the Capehart Chapel in Bellevue. Over five-hundred people attended the standing-room-only ceremony to pay their respects, including over two hundred #PatriotRiders. During Sergeant Allen’s second deployment, patrols became increasingly dangerous. On May 18, 2006 Seargeant Allen’s Humvee was struck by an IED, which killed him and three other service members. Shortly after their marriage, Calvin served in Iraq for the first time and Birgit moved to Bellevue to be closer to Calvin’s family while he was deployed. After a brief stint home, he deployed to Iraq for a second time. #NEHeroes Following his enlistment, Calvin soon shipped off to Fort Benning to complete his One Station Unit Training for the infantry. Shortly after graduation, he was assigned to a station in Germany. It was in Germany where Calvin met his wife, Birgit Although many expected he'd follow in his dad's footsteps by enlisting in the Air Force, his mother knew better: Calvin wanted to pave his own road in the Army. #NEHeroes #ProudNebraskan Calvin had a caring attitude, which extended to church on Sundays. He often volunteered to be an usher and displayed his musical talent in the choir. #NELeaders Calvin grew up in a military family. When his dad, Lonnie Sr., was assigned to @Offutt_AFB in Bellevue, he & his wife Sallie thought they would only be there for a short time. However, they enjoyed "the good life" and soon after the birth of their two sons, they decided to stay. Today, I will recall the life and service of Sergeant Lonnie "Calvin" Allen Jr., a native of Bellevue, Nebraska. #NEHeroes SOON: I’ll be speaking on the Senate floor to continue my tributes to #NEHeroes and honor Nebraskans who have lost their lives in battle.
