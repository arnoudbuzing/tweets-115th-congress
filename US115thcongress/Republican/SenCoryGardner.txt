It’s always a pleasure meeting with educators from our great state. On Tuesday, Joe Simo, the 2018 Colorado Principal of the Year from Centennial Middle School in Montrose stopped by my office to talk about his ideas to improve education in CO.pic.twitter.com/z0qhid9YiY This announcement is good for Ft. Carson, CO, and most importantly the right decision for our military. We made the case to the Army that Fort Carson’s incredible infrastructure, manpower, and support will guarantee an effective increase in the Army’s readiness and capabilities. I announced today with @SenBennetCO that after several meetings over the course of the past year with Army leadership, the Army will stand up a Stryker Brigade Combat Team at Ft. Carson in Colorado Springs. My prayers are with the Gaiter family. Lew Gaiter was a man of integrity, serving as Larimer County Commissioner for years while battling cancer. His leadership & devotion to family & community will be missed. The impact he left on us will not be forgotten. I will miss my friend. Complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization is United States and international law. These steps are important - inspectors must have full, unfettered access and accounting. … In the meantime, the Trump administration should immediately increase its diplomatic efforts to compel every entity — Russian or otherwise — to comply with international sanctions against North Korea. Without this pressure, North Korea will not denuclearize. We urge the Panel not to cave to Russian pressure and to release the original version of the report. Countries not applying pressure are enabling North Korea's advancing nuclear weapons program. Russia is acting in bad faith, and we join Ambassador Haley’s call for transparency and accountability on sanctions enforcement at the United Nations against North Korea. .@senmarkey & I joined @nikkihaley today in condemning Russian interference with a key UN Panel of Experts report concerning NK sanctions & calling for the release of the original version of the report, which implicates Russian entities in sanctions violations. I hosted a roundtable Tuesday in GJ that focused on the importance of Jordan Cove. This project would take liquified natural gas and turn it into fuel exports, creating a great source of energy in the US. Check out @dwebb40’s article to read more about it. … This is great news – the House Natural Resources Committee just passed a measure to reauthorize LWCF. There’s bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress. We need to get the job done to fund #LWCF. … Great to be in @SenCoryGardner’s hometown today with his regional director Darlene and visiting Yuma High School to showcase the impact of engineering on our state, nation & world. #BraunVoyagepic.twitter.com/4TDJXGmtDN Yesterday, I hosted a roundtable discussion w/ @SenCoryGardner on the importance of the Jordan Cove Project. The abundance of natural gas in W. CO puts us in a unique position to supply energy to U.S. allies and create jobs in CO.pic.twitter.com/22jhWiUQrk I held a roundtable yesterday w/ police from GJ, Palisade, & Fruita. It's critical that our first responders have the resources they need to fight the opioid epidemic. I appreciated their insights as we discussed the legislation I’ve introduced to help stop this crisis.pic.twitter.com/Gz7YRqqSNT Following NBC report about sonic attacks, @SenCoryGardner renews calls for declaring Russia a state sponsor of terror  This includes the invasion of Ukraine, the support for the murderous Assad regime in Syria, and assassinations on foreign soil. Russia is a state sponsor of terrorism, and it is time we treat them that way. Vladimir Putin cannot continue to operate with impunity and it is time we impose tough and lasting consequences for Russia’s actions that undermine civilized norms and international law. As the facts of this heinous act are further ascertained, I urge the Senate to pass my legislation requiring the State Department to consider the designation of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, and a comprehensive sanctions package against Russia I introduced last month. If these reports are true, this is a direct attack by Russia against the United States. … Seventeen years ago the United States experienced a horrendous act of evil and terror. We will #NeverForget the lives lost on 9/11 and we will continue to honor their memory.pic.twitter.com/d25XO6foH3 Exciting to see the South I-25 “Gap” project is underway.

I’ll continue to work with Interior and push my legislation to make our goal a reality.pic.twitter.com/Rhn5pzRUYv The U.S. must hold cyber attackers accountable - this action is the first of many that should be taken under cyber sanction laws Congress has passed. … Pleased to see this news about Jordan Cove after years of bipartisan work in Colorado. Leaders across the state must stand up for Colorado jobs and opportunity. … This bill is the product of decades of work by those in the music industry and represents a sensible step forward for record labels, artists, songwriters, and many others in music and entertainment. I appreciate Senator Hatch’s leadership on this issue. After thorough and successful conversations with stakeholders over the last several weeks, I’m cosponsoring @senorrinhatch's bipartisan Music Modernization Act. The preservation of our country’s natural lands, water resources, and opportunities for recreational activities rely on this vital program, which is why I have cosponsored legislation to permanently reauthorize and fully fund LWCF. Since its creation more than half a century ago, LWCF has invested over $268 million in conserving Colorado’s lands, water, and open spaces. This program has supported 42,000 state and local conservation projects across the nation. Today marks one month until #LWCF’s funding expires. It is critical that the crown jewel of conservation programs receives permanent reauthorization of its funding before September 30th. I hope Kim Jong Un will come to his senses and fulfill the promise he made. I remain committed to a peaceful resolution but will not allow the United States to be fooled again. North Korea must also know that while the US & its partners are seeking to solve this crisis peacefully, we will not hesitate to defend the US homeland, our troops in the region, and our treaty allies, with overwhelming military force. This means imposing additional unilateral sanctions against the NK regime and ensuring that our American military presence on the Korean peninsula is maintained at current troop levels. We must also continue to coordinate our NK policy closely with Seoul and Tokyo. We can all be pleased that NK hasn’t conducted any recent missile tests, but this doesn't mean the Kim regime is on the path towards complete, verifiable, irreversible, denuclearization. The US must immediately resume a complete maximum pressure campaign against North Korea. As I said here yesterday, I applaud Sec. Mattis for announcing we will resume military exercises with South Korea. The US engaged in a good-faith effort after the Singapore summit while North Korea, once again, did not. Kim Jong Un has a choice - denuclearize or continue leading a country in isolation withering under maximum pressure. … Jaime and I are praying for Cindy and the entire McCain family. John was a patriot and hero, and I’ll miss his leadership in the Senate. This is the right thing to do. North Korea continues to violate UN and US sanctions and has shown little intention of peaceful denuclearization. Until the North Korean regime changes course, the US campaign of maximum pressure must continue. … Senator McCain is a friend and hero. God bless him and his family. … Today is an unbelievable day for the Chapman family of Colorado Springs. Tech. Sgt. John A. Chapman’s bravery and service have been honored by awarding him the highest award for valor given to an Airman since the Vietnam War, the Medal of Honor. El Salvador has made the wrong decision regarding Taiwan, and it will negatively influence US relations with El Salvador. The US govt must stand up to China’s campaign to bully Taiwan with every tool we have. … Exciting news that Adams County received license to move forward with a commercial spaceport at Front Range Airport. This is a positive step as the County seeks to provide commercial space service. This is the right decision by the Administration. The United States cannot and should not be silent in the face of horrific human rights abuses in Burma. … To stay updated on my work in Colorado and Washington, subscribe to my newsletter by clicking on the link below. … It was a privilege to have @ENERGY @SecretaryPerry and @SenCoryGardner  visit us today to see first-hand how we're #TransformingEnergy through world-class science.

Thank you, President @iingwen, for meeting yesterday during your transit through the US. As China continues its aggressive and unwarranted campaign to delegitimize Taiwan, the strong reaffirmation of America’s support for the people of Taiwan is more important than ever. … I’ll continue to work to ensure @NREL has the necessary funding to keep producing amazing results for this country and the rest of the world.pic.twitter.com/RM4vtIElVH I had an excellent visit to @NREL today with @SecretaryPerry.

But Cory Gardner Wants to Go Further.  This is the right decision. Russia must face consequences for carrying out a chemical attack on the soil of a NATO ally. Congress should take up my bill to require @StateDept to consider naming Russia a State Sponsor of Terror, which will result in more sanctions against Russia. … The Congressional Badge of Bravery is awarded to individuals who exhibit bravery while protecting the lives of others, without regard for their own personal safety.

Watch this video to see one of the many reasons why! … A bipartisan group of senators (@LindseyGrahamSC, @SenJohnMcCain, @SenatorMenendez, @SenatorShaheen, @SenCoryGardner, @SenatorCardin) is introducing a Russia sanctions package. Here's what they say the legislation will do:pic.twitter.com/s9zjU1MZih Unless Russia fundamentally changes its behavior, we must not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that tried to normalize relations with a nation that continues to pose a serious threat to the United States and our allies. This bipartisan measure will impose further economic sanctions against the Kremlin and includes my language requiring the State Department to determine whether Russia merits the designation of a State Sponsor of Terror, joining Kremlin allies Iran and Syria. The United States must continue to take strong actions against Vladimir Putin’s Russia for their global violations of international law and repeated attempts to undermine U.S. democratic institutions. This comprehensive legislation will increase economic, political, and diplomatic pressure on the Russian Federation in response to Russia’s continued interference in our elections, malign influence in Syria, aggression in Crimea, and other activities. My colleagues and I just introduced a bipartisan sanctions package against Russia. It is one of the most hard-hitting pieces of legislation ever introduced against the Russian Federation. @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorCardin @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorShaheen @SenatorMenendez Topline summary of the new @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorCardin @SenCoryGardner @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorShaheen Russia sanctions package released today:pic.twitter.com/YWD8FetyxN 142 years ago on this day Colorado became the 38th state to join the Union. Today we take the time to celebrate all our great state has to offer. Happy Colorado Day!pic.twitter.com/pTPOUMmPb1 Alyson and I waited out the storm and came across this shortly after the storm went through. Rough evening on the prairie.pic.twitter.com/KSDojpbnKH As the Constitution requires and this legislation reaffirms, any change proposed by this administration or future administrations regarding America’s standing in this alliance can be done only with the advice and consent of the Senate. I support the United States’ continued commitment to the alliance, including the provisions that require the armed support of all members in case of an attack on any one member, as was exercised after the 9/11 attack against the United States. Today I joined @timkaine, @SenJohnMcCain & @SenJackReed in introducing a bill that would prevent the United States from leaving NATO without the Senate's consent. NATO is the most successful military alliance in history, & any effort to abandon it would be a monumental mistake. Bipartisan group in Senate — @SenCoryGardner @SenJohnMcCain @SenJackReed @timkaine —introduced a bill to “explicitly prohibit the President of the United States from withdrawing from NATO without Senate approval.” What an experience for these young Coloradans! These @NationalFFA members had the opportunity to meet Judge Brett Kavanaugh before our meeting in my Senate office earlier today. Thanks Judge Kavanaugh for taking the time to say hello to them. … I'll be joining @foxandfriends shortly to discuss @SecPompeo's testimony yesterday to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. … I questioned Secretary Mike Pompeo today in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing about North Korea and got important answers about status of #denuclearization and about #maximumpressure against Kim Jong Un and his odious regime. … Thank you to both of Colorado's Senators, @SenBennetCO and @SenCoryGardner, for coming together to #SaveLWCF in this wonderful article - LWCF is a bright spot of bipartisan cooperation! … As thousands gather in Denver this week for the @OutdoorRetailer Summer Market, @SenCoryGardner & I are calling for full funding & permanent reauthorization of #LWCF to protect the land & water that are the foundation of our outdoor rec economy. … I look forward to continuing to work with the VA and Mr. Wilkie to make sure that the federal government is doing everything it can to treat those who have served our country with honor. The failures in the construction of this facility are well-documented and represent a dark chapter in the VA’s history - I have made it clear to Mr. Wilkie that the VA’s past errors are to never be repeated. Patients must have access to timely care, even if that means seeing a doctor outside of a VA medical facility. This past weekend, I was honored to attend the ribbon cutting for the Rocky Mountain Regional Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Aurora. Our veterans deserve a healthcare system that will make certain that they are getting the best care possible, but that won’t be possible unless the VA continues to reform the way it does business. The Land and Water Conservation Fund empowers communities to prioritize conservation. It boosts the economy, conserves our lands and increases tourism. @SenBennetCO and I introduced legislation to permanently reauthorize the program. … Congratulations to the many veterans who fought for this day, as we celebrate what will be the crown jewel of the VA system. I'll continue to do everything in my power to make sure that veterans’ projects like these are never mismanaged again. We have more work to do, together. … I was at a @cvspharmacy in Denver today to learn more about the drug disposal boxes they have started putting in stores.

From @SenCoryGardner in April:  Is Russia Sponsoring Terrorism?  5PM UPDATE: @SenCoryGardner is renewing his call to direct the Department of State to consider whether Russia should join Iran and North Korea as a known state sponsor of terrorism. #copolitics  pic.twitter.com/cUKnvKsXe4 If the answer is yes, Russia would face restrictions on American foreign assistance, a ban on American defense exports and sales, limits on American sales of certain items that have both civilian and military uses, and other financial and other restrictions. My legislation would require the State Department to determine within 90 days whether the Russian Federation meets the criteria to be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. Russia is officially responsible for a chemical weapons attack against a NATO member state on its own soil — a brazen violation of sovereignty of our closest ally. It requires a serious American response. Earlier this year, the Kremlin had crossed yet another previously unimaginable line, when it used a military-grade nerve agent to poison a former Russian intelligence agent and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury. Russia has invaded its neighbors Georgia & Ukraine, it supports the murderous Assad regime & our enemies in Afghanistan, & it is engaged in active information warfare against Western democracies, including meddling in the 2016 United States elections. Three months ago, I introduced legislation that would direct the State Department to consider adding Russia to its list of state sponsors of terrorism, alongside its close allies Iran and Syria. The moral case for such a designation is sound. .@SenCoryGardner statement on #Helsinki meeting: "Nothing should change as of today – Putin’s Russia is not a friend to the United States.”pic.twitter.com/qfMTscBWcY Statement just out from @SenCoryGardner calls for enforcing sanctions against Russia, determining if Russia is a state sponsor of terror, adds: "Nothing should change as of today – Putin’s Russia is not a friend to the United States."  #copoliticspic.twitter.com/qD5wdHST3u The only ‘reset’ we can have with Russia is when it completely reverses course and begins to act in accordance with civilized norms and international law. Nothing should change as of today – Putin’s Russia is not a friend to the United States. I encourage the Administration to avoid the mistakes of past Administrations in normalizing relations with Russia at zero cost to Putin and his regime. Additionally, I will continue to support maximum economic sanctions on Russia, including the full implementation of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) that passed the Senate by a vote of 98-2. I believe Russia is a state sponsor of terror and I’ve introduced legislation that would mandate the State Department to determine whether Russia merits this designation, along with their allies Iran and Syria that are already designated. Whether it be chemical attacks on our allied soil, the invasion of Ukraine, propping up the murderer Assad in Syria, or meddling in our elections through cyber-attacks, Vladimir Putin’s Russia remains an adversary to the United States. Earlier this week I spoke on the Senate floor & a National Parks subcommittee hearing about the importance of Congress passing the Restore Our Parks Act. Check out @FOX21News story on how this legislation can address the over $238 million maintenance backlog at Colorado’s parks.pic.twitter.com/6ofH7aWA8b Kudos @SenCoryGardner for working with your Senate colleagues and supporting the funding of America's most important conservation program, the Land and Water Conservation Act! #saveLWCFpic.twitter.com/LLBovuSdcH I thank the @LWCFCoalition for their commitment to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the crown jewel of our nation’s conservation programs.

She is a a well-qualified jurist, mainstream conservative, & someone who will take the cases where the law leads her & not try to legislate from the bench. I sent a letter to @realDonaldTrump today urging him to nominate Judge Allison Eid to fill Justice Kennedy's seat. Judge Eid currently serves on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Colorado. Should people caught flying drones over wildfires be charged with a federal felony? #copolitics … I wish him the best of luck in this next chapter of his remarkable life. I want to thank Justice Kennedy for his years of service on the Supreme Court. Since President Reagan appointed him from the court of appeals more than 30 years ago, Justice Kennedy has carefully and thoughtfully approached each case that has come before him.

Until such time as North Korea takes concrete steps to denuclearize, our policy should be to continue the maximum pressure campaign. Today’s summit must be followed by multiple meetings to test North Korea’s promises of denuclearization, which they have made in the past and then repeatedly violated. The Trump Administration, under Congressional direction, deserves praise for abandoning the failed policy of strategic patience and pursuing a maximum pressure campaign that has resulted in unprecedented sanctions against this heinous regime.

Be sure to tune in here: … We must verify BEFORE we trust. The stakes are high. @POTUS can change the course of history, but it must be done through a position of strength and be consistent with long-standing U.S. policy and national security goals. 11/11 Kim Jong Un must know that we will not hesitate to protect the U.S. homeland, our troops in the region, and our treaty allies, with overwhelming military force, if necessary. 10/11 In the meantime, as I wrote in my letter yesterday with my colleagues on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committee, sanctions and joint military exercises w/ our allies must continue.  … 9/11 As a starting point for any negotiations, we must demand that the regime adheres to the commitments it has already made to the United States to denuclearize, and has since repeatedly violated. 8/11 My new bipartisan bill, the LEED Act, would impose an economic embargo on North Korea and its enablers, wherever they are based. You can read more about it here:  … 7/11 The maximum pressure campaign that my legislation started, and President Trump has continued, has brought us to this point today. Now we need to keep up the pressure and negotiate from a position of strength. 6/11 But we haven’t received any of these commitments from North Korea to date. 5/11 Per U.S. law, the President must demand that NK make significant progress toward complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization & comply with all UN Security Council Resolutions before any sanctions relief or normalization of relations with NK can be considered. 4/11 This legislation, the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, was signed into law in February 2016. It now forms the basis of the maximum pressure campaign against North Korea. The law sets a high bar for any lifting of sanctions on North Korea. See below. 3/11pic.twitter.com/H1MUWHygI4 As Chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee focused on East Asia policy, I held a series of hearings and began working on legislation that would require mandatory sanctions on the regime and would set parameters for U.S. policy toward North Korea. 2/11 THREAD: When I was sworn in to the Senate in 2015, I referred to Kim Jong Un as the “Forgotten Maniac”. At the time, few were paying attention to the grave threat posed by NK to the US and our allies, while the Obama Admin. followed a failing policy of “strategic patience”. 1/11 I sent a letter to the President today urging him to continue his maximum pressure campaign & I do not think this announcement should change US resolve until DPRK takes concrete steps toward full denuclearization. You can read my full letter here:  … 3/3 Kim Jong Un must take concrete steps toward total denuclearization and President Trump must demand it. 2/3 The price of admission for a meeting between @POTUS and Kim Jong Un must be the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 1/3 Thanks to Manufacturer’s Edge and other Colorado manufacturers for stopping by my office today to discuss cybersecurity and how we can continue to grow the economy.pic.twitter.com/59ayV4csVB Investing tax savings in its employees and lowering prices for customers -- tax relief continues to work for Coloradans. #TaxCutsAndJobsAct … Thanks for stopping by! … I spoke with @SecretaryZinke today about my continued efforts to move the Bureau of Land Management headquarters West and appreciate his work with me on this issue.pic.twitter.com/hO7eJbHkaK I had the honor of presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star, and Air Medal to Fort Collins resident Robert Thydean for his heroic service during the Vietnam War.

I was proud to fight for this grant at the federal level and am thrilled to deliver this news to southern Colorado.pic.twitter.com/HuDFa9kFRo Our goal of discussions w/ NK should remain the complete, verifiable & irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, & I urge the Admin. to continue a maximum pressure campaign, including robust sanctions enforcement & joint military exercises, until that goal is met. While this statement of intent from North Korea is a positive development, we have been down this road before, so we need to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past that have led us to the crisis today. … We're excited to announce the four recipients of our 2018 Legislative Action Awards: @SenCoryGardner (R-CO), @SenAngusKing (I-ME), Rep. @SusanWBrooks (R-IN), and @CongressmanRuiz (D-CA).  pic.twitter.com/hKW4KauAeG Earlier this week, I met with the nominee to be the Director of the United States Geological Survey, Dr. James Reilly II, who hails from Colorado Springs.pic.twitter.com/Vvx6H1AtK2 Thank you to @SD27J for this wonderful parade thanking our first responders!

Earlier this Congress, I introduced the bipartisan LEED Act that gives those that currently conduct trade with North Korea a clear choice – either do business with this heinous outlaw regime or do business with the world’s leading economic and military power. Pleased to see today’s announcement of increased sanctions against NK. We must continue to take every diplomatic & economic measure to stop NK & prevent nuclear war. More ships interdicted, less money to the Kim regime - UN & China must follow suit with increased pressure. It was an honor to serve with you, Ken - thanks for your leadership. … I’m disappointed we weren't able to find a solution today but that does not mean our work is over.

We need a strong plan for rural economic development that includes broadband deployment to help close the #digitaldivide. #SOTU (3/7) Tax cuts have already resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in new investment and growing wages. Let’s continue to grow the economy and reduce the burden of Washington on hardworking Americans. #SOTU (2/7) I look forward to hearing from the President tonight and hope he addresses a few key policy areas I’ve outlined below that are important to Colorado. #SOTU (1/7) I spent Friday morning at the Colorado State Capitol celebrating Military Appreciation Day.
