President Obama is downright hostile to the cause of protecting life. #prolife Instead we should set our sights on winning the war & that only comes about by electing a President & Congress committed to protecting life.

President Obama’s deal with Iran is hemorrhaging support from the American people. President Obama's speech today is just another example of his reliance on endless strawmen to divert attention from his failed policies. Pres Obama’s Iran deal empowers 1 the world’s most radical Islamist regime with the means to acquire a new military arsenal. President Obama’s Iran deal empowers 1 of our chief antagonists & the world’s most radical Islamist regime with money to pay for the bomb. Pres Obama’s deal Iran deal empowers 1 of our chief antagonists & the world’s most radical Islamist regime with missiles to deliver a bomb. Pres Obama’s Iran deal empowers 1 of our chief antagonists and the world’s most radical Islamist regime with a pathway to the bomb. Pres Obama is trying hard to sell a bad deal with Iran & American people aren’t buying it. Straw man arguments are not going to help. On Mideast policy: When will everyone realize Pres Obama doesn’t know what he’s doing? Clearly the Iranians have figured this out. Now the House of Representatives must take up the challenge and reauthorize #ExImBank. Great day for the American worker!

Would I like to live in a world where there were no #ExIm Banks? Sure. But I refuse to close our ExIm Bank and China keeps theirs open. If our #ExIm Bank and its competitive financing go away permanently, the United States will lose market share and it will cost us jobs. I refuse to live in a world where we close our #ExIm Bank and China keeps theirs open. I am not doing that. That is unilateral surrender. The #EXIM Bank plays an instrumental role in helping American manufacturers sell American-made products overseas. American people and Congress should know every detail about how Iranian military facilities can/cannot be inspected. #IranDeal Any side agreements b/w IAEA and Iran – not shared with Congress – makes agreement a non-starter. #IranDeal A standing ovation from Code Pink?  The best sign yet this is NOT a good deal. #IranDeal Congress is not bound by today’s UN decision. I look forward to a full and complete debate in the coming weeks. #IranDeal (2/2)........affront to the American people & further evidence of a weak president trying to sell a bad deal. Taking it to the UN before Congress reviews it is an affront to the American people......(1/2) #IranDeal The Iranian deal may be good enough for the United Nations but it's a terrible deal for the United States. #IranDeal My thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the four Marines who were killed in today’s horrific attack. Stories on #PlannedParenthood actions appear to be a chapter out of some sick science fiction novel. Unfortunately, they are true. #PlannedParenthood is harvesting body parts from aborted babies. We must pass my Pain-Capable bill to stop these late term abortions. Unfortunately, Assad is correct. Deal is a ‘Great Victory’ for Iran - a bad one for the US, Israel, and our allies. … More money, weapons, and a locked in nuclear capability -- without any requirement to change behavior -- is the essence of the Iran deal. This deal is far worse than I ever dreamed it could be... nightmare for our own national security, region, & eventually the world at large. The goal was to dismantle the Iranian nuclear program.

Certification by the president Iran changed its aggressive behavior & no longer qualifies as a designated state sponsor of terrorism. #7. Removal of all enriched uranium from Iran. No need for Iran to possess a large stockpile of low enriched or any highly enriched uranium. #6. Iran must NOT be allowed to conduct research and development on advanced centrifuges. #5. There must be an explicit process for the 'snapback' re-imposition of sanctions if Iran violates the deal. #4. Sanctions relief/access to funds be phased in & fully conditioned on IAEA certification Iran in full & sustained compliance. #3.  Anytime, anywhere inspections of all Iranian military and nonmilitary facilities. #2. Closure of all hardened and formerly secret sites. Iran must come clean on all outstanding issues raised by the IAEA. #1. Iran must not be allowed an enrichment capability greater than the practical needs to supply one commercial reactor. My 8 Principles to ensure we get the right answers and achieve a sound, enforceable deal regarding Iran's nuclear program. .@WSJ Much More Is Needed to Stop #Iran From Getting the Bomb … Bottom line: Pres Obama is doing the least possible when it comes to destroying ISIL. Intends to pass this problem to next president. Great job to our troops in raid that killed top ISIL leader.  Good call by President Obama, but this does not make-up for lack of strategy.

Now I hope the House of Reps will soon pass the Iran legislation and place it on the President's desk for his signature into law. I want to thank @SenBobCorker @BenCardinforMD and @timkaine for their leadership in helping push this legislation through the Senate. I believe any deal with Iran should be verifiable and include conditions to ensure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon.

Gadahn served as a chief spokesman for al-Qaeda while Farouq was a top-level operative in the organization.

Yemen is but the latest, yet I fear probably not the last, example of President Obama’s failing foreign policy. Our nation continues to be weakened by the Obama Admin's lack of an overall strategy to deal with the threat posed by radical Islam. AQAP is a committed enemy of the United States and is believed to have been responsible for the recent terror attacks in Paris. #Yemen I fear these latest developments will create a vacuum that will ultimately benefit al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). #Yemen It’s long been clear Yemen was not the ‘success story’ that President Obama once claimed it to be. … Sen.

This latest episode once again shows that under President Obama’s leadership it is better to be America’s enemy than her friend. #Ukraine It is time for President Obama to quit equivocating and quickly provide #Ukraine the defensive weapons it needs. The Ukrainian people do not have time for President Obama’s “strategic patience.” President Obama’s continual weakness in the face of aggression is making the world a more dangerous place. The Obama Doctrine of leading from behind and showing weakness in face of aggression seems to be spreading throughout the world. There was no mention of defensive weapons, but I hope that will be the Obama Administration's next step. #Ukraine #MSC2015 .@VP Biden's challenge to all nations to stand up to Russia and stand behind #Ukraine will matter -- if heeded. #MSC2015 The translated version of Obama's “Strategic Patience” -- I can’t wait to pass this mess I made onto someone else. (RT if you agree.) The Obama Doctrine, or “Strategic Patience,” has led to a world in chaos. The consequences of Obama’s “Strategic Patience” are an America that is less secure and at greater risk. I doubt ISIL, the Iranian mullahs, or Vladmir Putin will be intimidated by President Obama’s strategy of ‘Strategic Patience.’ My thoughts and prayers today are with the students, faculty, and staff of my alma mater, the @UofSC. #PrayForUSC This is a fight between a struggling democracy and an autocratic dictatorship.

He was a pioneer for the Republican Party and continued to stay involved in party building activities throughout his life. He was truly one of the most decent men to have ever served as governor of South Carolina. It was with great sadness I learned of the passing of Governor Edwards today. SUNDAY: Interviews with @marcorubio, @GrahamBlog and @ChrisVanHollen This week we're talking about Obama's #Cuba policy and the #SonyHack. Modernizing cyber-security laws & working to protect national interests against cyber-terrorism should be a top priority 4 Congress in 2015. Unfortunately, these latest attacks highlight our nation’s vulnerabilities. We should make it clear to our adversaries when they attack our American companies & government institutions they will be held accountable. Commander-in-Chief should immediately put our enemies on notice they conduct these attacks against our nation & interests at their own peril Cyber-terrorism is increasingly becoming the weapon of choice for rogue regimes and terrorist organizations. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on normalizing relations with Cuba? #DeafeningSilence I will do all in my power to block the use of funds to open an embassy in Cuba.  Normalizing relations with Cuba is bad idea at a bad time. This is an incredibly bad idea. #Cuba  … This session of Congress finally, mercifully comes to an end.  … Will be speaking with WRHI Rock Hill this morning at 8:50 am.  LISTEN LIVE:   I haven't seen Harry Reid smile like this in years.   I don't like it one bit. The Surgeon General nominee - previously blocked - will be confirmed due to missteps. He was far to radical to serve. Some of the tactics employed today will result in numerous Obama nominees - previously blocked - to end up being confirmed. We need to learn to not repeat the mistakes of the past. The American people expect, if not outright demand, better from us. (2/2)....I say that ideological belief had no basis in reality. Finally to those who believe shutting down the government will get President Obama to repeal his Executive Order on immigration...(1/2) Tonight, the majority of House Democrats showed they were not serious about governing the country. To the nearly 70% of House Democrats who rejected this bill, I hope you now realize why you were fired by the American people this November. It was a job well done by Speaker Boehner and his team in securing the necessary votes. I appreciate the wisdom, courage, maturity & leadership shown by the 70% of House GOP who voted in support of avoiding government shutdown. (2/2).... and contains many important provisions affecting our state and nation I applaud the GOP controlled House of Representatives for passing a government funding bill which stays within our spending limits....(1/2) Coast Guard’s Air Facility Charleston will stay open until at least January 1, 2016.

A nuclear-capable Iran represents an existential threat to our strongest ally in the region, Israel. Iranian insistence on having an enrichment program is problematic and fear it could lead to a repeat of the mistakes made with North Korea. One of the most important issues facing our nation & world at large is how to prevent #Iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability. Statment with @KellyAyotte and @SenJohnMcCain on Iranian nuclear negotiations.  … #Iran 3 potential replacements been mentioned - Sen Jack Reed, Michele Flournoy, & Ashton Carter - solid choices for important position. #SecDef It’s clear to me Sec Hagel realizes our failures in Syria have greatly contributed to destabilization in Iraq & robust response is required. I particularly appreciate his recent efforts to speak truth to power when it comes to our failed strategy in Syria and Iraq. I appreciate Secretary Hagel’s life-long service to our country. President Obama's executive action is wrong. WATCH:  Senators Graham, Rubio, McCain letter to President Obama opposing executive action on immigration. READ:  … President Obama's executive action is wrong. It’s irresponsible.  It will do damage to our efforts to fix a broken immigration system. There will be some Democrats who will join the effort to limit an overreach of executive authority.  On Obama's Executive Action: "Our response has to be measured — can't capitulate, can't overreact."   I’ve got a simple goal -- when the deal is done I don’t want capability left in Iranian hands that could be converted to weapons use. #Iran It is insane to give the Iranians any enrichment capabilities.  Enrichment should be off the table. #Iran If #Iran wants a nuclear power program for peaceful purposes, fine....build a reactor, control the fuel cycle. Any deal negotiated with the P5+1 regarding the Iranian nuclear program should be brought to Congress for review, debate, and a vote. #Iran In minutes, Sen Lindsey Graham @GrahamBlog LIVE on what a Republican Senate will accomplish:  Ocare, #Keystone, #Immigration and #Iran. 2015 May See a Senate Probe into #Benghazi, Graham wants the new Senate to set up a Select Committee  ICYMI: Graham takes to Senate floor to push for vote on #Iran Nuclear Negotiations Act. WATCH:  Nobody wants any more war but we do NOT want the Iranians -- given their behavior -- a capability to one day to develop a nuclear weapon. The idea that we would give #Iran enrichment capability just astounds me. I would welcome a deal that allows Iranians to produce peaceful nuclear power but without capability of turning it into a weapons program. I would like to bring the Iranian nuclear program to an end through peaceful means. #Iran Chart currently being used on the Senate floor. #Iranpic.twitter.com/nctjlZB46D Now on the floor of the Senate to request Roll Call vote on Iran Nuclear Negotiations Act of 2014.

That is a formula for disaster. The sooner we engage ISIL and destroy them, the safer we will be at home. If ISIL takes Kobani they will be able to recruit more jihadists from Europe and other places. President Obama's strategy of half-measures is making it much more likely that America will be hit by another terror attack. About to go on-air with WRNN Radio in Myrtle Beach.  LISTEN:   @WRNN995 We're busy at the Chamber today, gearing up for tomorrow's big annual luncheon. Sen. Lindsey Graham will offer...   If you had any doubt...President Obama’s foreign policy has hit rock bottom.  Look forward to discussing Harbor deepening tomorrow in Charleston. #CHS52 #CHSNEWS Going to 52 feet is absolutely critical for the Charleston Port, the state, and region. #CHS52 #CHSNEWS I’m very pleased the Charleston Harbor port deepening feasibility study is nearing completion. #CHS52 #CHSNEWS The rapid rise of #ISIS.

Graham discussed the Bilateral Security Agreement with #Afghanistan on Fox News Radio earlier today. LISTEN:   Under Obama’s current withdrawal plan, we lose virtually all US counter-terrorism capability in Afghanistan by 2017. Now, Pres Obama needs to revise his Afghan withdrawal plan. If not substantially changed, we will see a repeat of what happened in Iraq. I very much appreciate the Afghanistan government signing the Bilateral Security Agreement between our two nations.

America stands with you. #HongKong #OccupyCentral Raising your voice today and demanding more freedom is the best gift you can give future generations.  #HongKong #OccupyCentral I appreciate AG Holder’s service to our country even though we had strong disagreements at times. I wish him well in future endeavors. Putin doesn’t fear or respect President Obama’s words.  He would respect a well-trained Ukrainian army fighting for their freedom. President Obama condemning Russia without arming Ukraine is empty rhetoric. (2/2)  However, President Obama pledging not to use ground forces against ISIL emboldens the enemy.  They hear what we will NOT do. President rightly said radical Islamists only understand  “language of force.” (1/2) A missed opportunity today by the President to detail a clear, decisive strategy to defeat radical Islam and deter aggressors like Putin. Stmt w/ @GrahamBlog commending Pres Obama for ordering air strikes vs #ISIS in #Syria - should be opening salvo:  … In pulling back from America’s traditional leadership role, Pres Obama left a vacuum for other more dangerous actors  Time after time President Obama had the opportunity to act when US engagement could have made a decisive difference.  Time after time President Obama had the opportunity to act when US engagement could have made a decisive difference.  Obama & the Rise of ISIS:  President’s delays, retreats, inaction have allowed the terrorist movement to metastasize.  Congratulations to Dr. Ashraf Ghani & Dr. Abdullah Abdullah on reaching a power sharing agreement which benefits the people of Afghanistan.

WATCH:   About to question Secretary Hagel and General Dempsey in Senate Armed Services Committee.  WATCH:   S.C. Senator Lindsey Graham says that Obama's claim that the U.S. is safer now than before 9/11 is untrue.  There are more terrorist organizations with more money, more capability, and more weapons to attack our homeland than existed before 9/11. Last night President Obama tried to tell us that as a nation we're safer today than we've ever been.   Do you agree with that?  I don't. About to speak on the Senate floor about the threat posed to the United States by ISIL. Available on C-Span 2. ISIL now poses a direct threat to the American people and homeland and must be vanquished. #ISIS There are risks associated with any decision, but today the biggest risk is to continue on the current path of doing nothing. #ISIS Graham Discusses ISIS Threat, Obama's Foreign Policy in Lead-Up to Address on ISIS WATCH: … When President Obama talks about destroying our enemies -- then talks about what he WON’T DO – our enemies see weakness. #ISIS Unfortunately, I don’t think our enemies FEAR and RESPECT President Obama. #ISIS President Obama has been weak and indecisive in the face of threats from Putin and terrorist threats like ISIS.

Had a great meeting with @GrahamBlog and his staff while in DC.pic.twitter.com/ymSsJAgKNO Anything short of that only emboldens our enemies and shakes the resolve of our friends and allies. #ISIS America’s focus should be singular in nature – confront/defeat ISIS. Mr. President, the days of trying to “manage” radical Islamic groups like ISIS needs to end.  Almost 200,000 dead in Syria, near collapse of Iraq, and the rise of the world's most sinister terrorist army...   Sen. Lindsey Graham @grahamblog is ready for the U.S. to take decisive action against #ISIS  pic.twitter.com/xvuAKmv9X2 Mr. President, if you can’t come up with a strategy, at least tell us what the goal is regarding ISIL. Whenever American air power has been employed, in coordination with reliable partners on the ground, ISIL has been devastated. However, condemnation is not enough to deal with this scourge.  It is time we act decisively against ISIL wherever it resides. Our hearts and prayers go out to the family of Mr. Sotloff and all those who have suffered under ISIL’s barbaric behavior. President Obama doesn’t have a strategy to deal with ISIL....does he at least have a goal?  All the bad actors in the world are taking advantage of a weak American president. #ISIL #ISIS #Putin #Russia #Iran Will be speaking with .@FoxNews Radio Brian .@kilmeade in just a few minutes about the threat posed by ISIL.

They must be defeated & cannot be beaten without attacking their safe haven in Syria. The White House is trying to minimize the threat we face in order to justify not changing a failed strategy. #ISIL (2/2)....protect our homeland by not aggressively confronting ISIL wherever they reside, including Syria.
