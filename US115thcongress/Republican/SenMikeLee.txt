It was our pleasure! I look forward to seeing you all again in #UT. #utpol … I am a Republican because I am conservative. I am a conservative because I believe the Constitution and the ideals it asserts on behalf of all Americans are worth protecting.

Let me know the next time you're in Utah - I would love to show you around! … #CriminalJusticeReform is gaining momentum, but sharing the personal impacts of why it matters is important if we are to get it over the finish line.

Tune in live at 11p ET on Fox News Channel.pic.twitter.com/i9gMKOdaSt Here’s a quick takeaway of my thoughts as we wrap up day 2 of the #Kavanaugh hearings.pic.twitter.com/nRe6cvMyzx HAPPENING NOW: @SenMikeLee questioning #Kavanaugh By 10:05 am — less than 30 minutes after the hearing began — I counted 18 acts of disruption. #Utah senators weigh in during heated hearing for #SCOTUS nominee. #utpol @abc4utah @senorrinhatch @SenMikeLee … Here’s a quick update on today’s #SCOTUS hearing so far:pic.twitter.com/8rEnaUFsyr There’s a better way for the #Senate to approach its work. This process should be about a jurist’s qualifications, character, and approach to judging. It should not be about results in a select number of cases. This undermines the legitimacy of the courts. Over time, no free people would accept a judiciary that simply imposes its own preferences on the country, absent fidelity to legal principle. Every current member of the Supreme Court has adhered to a similar principle. Sure enough, last term in Ortiz v. United States, #SCOTUS considered a case implicating the scope of Marbury. Likewise, Justice Ginsburg created the so-called “Ginsburg standard”—no previews, forecasts, or hints. Nominees, for the most part, have resisted trading confirmation in exchange for promises on how they’ll vote. To give two famous examples: Justice Scalia refused to say whether Marbury v. Madison was settled law, on the ground that it could come before him. This history shows that, over the better part of a century, the Judiciary Committee has gradually created a norm in which members demand that nominees talk about specific cases in return for favorable treatment. Without getting into the gory details, suffice to say that Senator Ted Kennedy and Judge Bork did not agree on constitutional law. Kennedy’s response was to savage – unfairly – the results he thought Bork would reach. Twenty-eight years later, the Senate considered Robert Bork’s nomination. This was another turning point, and in my view, remains a rock-bottom moment for the Senate. Justice Stewart’s 1959 nomination was another turning point. Senators seeking to resist Brown v. Board of Education wanted to grill Stewart about his views on integration. Others wanted to grill Stewart about his views on national security. But Senators also worried that Frankfurter was a radical based on his defense of anarchists in court. So again, Senators wanted assurances Frankfurter would reach certain results. Frankfurter, however, declined to engage w/Senators & insisted his public record spoke for itself The next important moment was in 1939, when Justice Frankfurter became the first #SCOTUS nominee to testify before the Senate. At the time, Frankfurter was controversial in part because he was he was born overseas. They didn’t ask Brandeis to testify, but asked outside witnesses to talk about his nomination. But Senators also wanted to determine whether Brandeis would use a seat on #SCOTUS to advocate for progressive causes he championed as a public-interest attorney. They wanted to know how he would vote in particular cases. The first #SCOTUS confirmation hearing occurred in 1916, when Justice Brandeis was nominated. Brandeis was controversial for several reasons—including, it has to be said, because he was Jewish. When you look at the history, that is precisely why confirmation hearings developed—so that Senators could ask nominees how they would vote in particular cases. Some of these unfair questions will ask him to promise to vote a certain way in particular cases likely to come before the Court. Over the next few days, senators will ask Judge #Kavanaugh questions about #SCOTUS cases, his record, and his qualifications. Some of these questions will be fair. Many others will be unfair. What is the real context of today’s #SCOTUS hearing? Here are some facts: Getting ready to go live on @foxandfriends to discuss this week’s #Kavanaugh #SCOTUS hearings. Tune in! Always a pleasure to talk with @guypbenson and Marie Harf!

The Committee is acting in a manner that is principled and consistent with Senate precedent. All members of the Senate have the ability to fully and fairly review the materials relevant to Kavanaugh’s judicial history. None of these papers will shine light on his legal approach. Being the inbox and outbox for a President doesn’t include giving legal advice; that’s the role for White House counsel, not the Staff Secretary. Democrats have made it clear that their goal is to bury the Committee in paper, just to delay a vote. Their minds were made up before Kavanaugh was even nominated. They don’t want to see the papers, they want to see his nomination stalled.pic.twitter.com/l8t4BWw9e9 Joining @chuckgrassley, @JohnCornyn, @senorrinhatch, @SenMikeLee, members of the @Senjudiciary to discuss the nomin… … 9:30AM: Joining @senjudiciary Chairman @ChuckGrassley, Senator @JohnCornyn, @senorrinhatch and @SenMikeLee to discuss Brett Kavanaugh's #SCOTUS nomination and Democrats' document demands and stall strategy.

Circuit in 2006. I know him to be a smart and fair judge, one of the most admired appellate judges in the country. #SCOTUS #SCOTUSpick As we celebrate the 4th, remember that those who fought to found our country did so because they believed individual rights are immense and worth fighting, sacrificing, and dying for. May we strive to honor their sacrifice. Have a happy 4th of July!  … #utpol The original Homestead Act helped create a thriving middle class in America, transferring millions of acres of federal land to hard working families. Last Friday, I joined @SutherlandInst to discuss what we can do to jumpstart this process again. #utpol … Salt Lake Chamber and @SenMikeLee Announce Support for S. 3013: Business and community leaders ask senators to safeguard trade relations:  … @USChamber @SenBobCorker #utpol #utecon #trade Let’s insist on a reassertion of the American people’s control over their government and of their land. #utpol #SIPublicLands When ordinary Americans control their communities and land, it is good for both. When the federal government wields exclusive control, it is good for neither. #utpol #SIPublicLands We have the opportunity to honor the promise the federal government made to Utah and Western states when they joined the Union. #utpol #SIPublicLands Small reforms here and there are important. But we have to start pushing for what we actually want. We must fight to return these lands. #utpol #SIPublicLands Finally, our long-term goal must be the transfer of federal lands to the states. And that is the aim of the third bill that I intend to introduce. #utpol #SIPublicLands This “new” Homestead Act would allow states, local governments, and individuals to petition the government to use federal land for affordable housing… or education… or health care. #utpol #SIPublicLands The second bill I plan to introduce is a new Homestead Act – one to help ordinary Americans in the 21st century. #utpol #SIPublicLands Specifically, my bill would prohibit the president from designating or expanding a national monument in the state unless both Congress and the state legislature pass resolutions approving the designation. #utpol #SIPublicLands The first, the Protecting Utah’s Rural Communities Act, would protect Utah from future Antiquities Act abuses by giving Utah the same protections currently enjoyed by Wyoming and Alaska. #utpol #SIPublicLands Our immediate task is to rein in that government and reclaim a space for ordinary Americans to live in freedom. I am working on three specific bills to do just that. #utpol #SIPublicLands Rural Americans want what all Americans want: a dignified, decent-paying job. A family to love and support. A healthy community whose future is determined by local residents—not by their self-styled betters thousands of miles away. #utpol #SIPublicLands Locals aren’t as lucky. While tourism has contributed much to the West, communities can’t survive on it alone. It is a complement to – not a substitute – for broader economic development. #utpol #SIPublicLands They delight in seeing vast swathes of untouched lands, fulfilling their idyllic notions of the West where they can jet in, spend a few days at the cabin, take pictures of animals, and then retreat to their enclaves on the coasts. #utpol #SIPublicLands Things have only gotten worse since. An even more extreme environmental movement, an alliance of privilege between celebrities, activists, and corporate elites now want to save the Earth at the expense of our rural communities. #utpol #SIPublicLands No longer would it be the official policy of the United States government to sell back the land and entrust it to the people. Instead, the policy would be to keep the land for itself.  #utpol #SIPublicLands And in 1976, Congress formalized federal control over federal lands by passing the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. This repealed the Homestead Acts and completely upended federal government’s public land policy. #utpol #SIPublicLands The amount of grazing on federal land went into steep decline, causing an exodus from the range that was never reversed. #utpol #SIPublicLands Between the mid-1960s and 1980, the amount of wilderness rose from 11.5 million acres to 82.7 million acres—an increase of 716% in less than two decades. #utpol #SIPublicLands The activists used land-use restrictions as an “all-purpose tool for stopping economic activity,” in the words of political scientist R. McGreggor Cawley. #utpol #SIPublicLands But in the 60s and 70s environmental activists began exploiting public fears about overpopulation and pollution. #utpol #SIPublicLands The first westerners were optimistic about federal control of western lands. Teddy Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot advocated for active management of the land, in cooperation with local interests. #utpol #SIPublicLands Fifty, sixty, even seventy percent of the land within Western states’ boundaries was – and remains – controlled by Washington. #utpol #SIPublicLands While they were ultimately successful in petitioning Congress to transfer their public lands from federal to state management, Western states have not been so lucky. #utpol #SIPublicLands Take Illinois and Missouri, for example. At one point, the federal government controlled more than 90% of their land. #utpol #SIPublicLands The promise to sell federal lands in Utah is right there, enshrined in federal law. But, unlike states farther East, the commitment to us was never honored. #utpol #SIPublicLands When Utah came into the Union in 1896, Section 9 of its statehood enabling legislation declared that public land located within the state “shall be sold by the United States subsequent to the admission of said state into the union.” #utpol #SIPublicLands While Easterners and Midwesterners had almost-total control of the land within their boundaries, Western states like Utah entered the Union on inferior terms – as tenants to negligent landlords. #utpol #SIPublicLands But by the time Utah and other states entered the Union, Congress had turned its attention elsewhere. Manifest destiny left us behind. #utpol #SIPublicLands The Homestead Acts were an engine for middle-class opportunity and growth and set the American standard for the disposition of public resources. #utpol #SIPublicLands The cornerstone of this policy was the Homestead Acts which transferred 270 million acres of land out of federal control and into the hands of ordinary Americans. #utpol #SIPublicLands Throughout the 19th century, Lawmakers sought to facilitate expansion of the nation by acquiring land—and then transferring it to the people, so they could live out their lives as responsible citizens of the republic. #utpol #SIPublicLands How did it come to pass that nearly half of the land in the West is owned by the federal government, compared to just 5 percent of the land in the East? #utpol #SIPublicLands WATCH LIVE: Major speech on public lands policy at @SutherlandInst: “Federal Lands and Royal Forests."  … #utpol #SIPublicLands Hogge passed away this week.

Lindsey Graham, scitis ut suus 'tempore legis agere cause cognicione vitae risus! לינדזי גרהם, אתה יודע שזה הזמן לחוקק את חוק אחריות הליך הוגן! Lindsey Graham, tu sabes que es hora de promulgar la Ley de Garantía de Debido Proceso! es hora de promulgar la Ley de Garantía de Debido Proceso Lindsey Graham, TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!  Let’s pass the Due Process Guarantee Act. Anyone who doesn’t want the Senate to pass the Due Process Guarantee Act enjoys the smell one experiences near a dog food factory. Anyone who doesn’t want the Senate to vote on the Due Process Guarantee Act likes Nickleback.  True fact! What’s the best argument you can think of for NOT letting the Senate vote on the Due Process Guarantee Act? The DPGA corrects the mistake Congress made in 2012 and protects Americans from indefinite government detention.  .… What kind of country would we have if we freely allowed our government to detain us indefinitely without charge, trial, or counsel? Please tell your senators to support the Due Process Guarantee Act as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act.  Let’s vote! By contrast, imagine the immense harm that could come from a law that authorizes the indefinite detention of American citizens! Where is the harm in a law saying that Americans can’t be indefinitely detained without charge or trial on US soil? Our govt isn’t now indefinitely detaining US citizens without charge or trial. But why leave a law in place that purports to authorize that? Why would anyone who voted for a nearly identical version of the DPGA in 2012 now deny his colleagues the right to cast this vote? Why block such a vote, especially when 68 senators wanted to take that vote? Why would a senator object to letting the Senate even VOTE on whether to protect Americans’ due process rights? Why would anyone choose to vote against a bill restoring existing constitutional protections that have been undermined by a bad law? Had we voted on the DPGA, it would have passed, protecting the due process rights of hundreds of millions of American citizens. The DPGA should have received a vote in the Senate.  A total of 68 senators voted against a motion to table the DPGA; they wanted a vote! The DPGA, which I authored along with @SenFeinstein, was pending as an amendment to this year’s National Defense Authorization Act. American citizens arrested on American soil should never be subject to indefinite detention without charge, trial, jury, or counsel. The American people cannot be asked to wait another moment before their due process rights are protected by the Due Process Guarantee Act. Each year, @SenFeinstein and I have been told we’d get a vote on the DPGA “at some point,” but it has not happened.  The time has come! Ever since 2012, @SenFeinstein and I have been trying to put the DPGA back into each year’s National Defense Authorization Act. @SenFeinstein and I introduced the DPGA in 2012. It passed with 67 votes, but was somehow removed from the NDAA before final passage. The DPGA was made necessary by Sec. 1021 of the 2012 NDAA, which purported to give the government unrestrained power to detain Americans. The Due Process Guarantee Act would protect U.S. citizens on U.S. soil from being detained indefinitely without charge, counsel, or trial. American citizens arrested on American soil should never be subject to indefinite detention without charge, trial, jury, or counsel. “When you use government to unfairly give your group, corporation, or business an advantage over others that are out there that don’t try to use that access to either fence-out or to increase profits, that’s bad.”  … How the Due Process Act can protect Americans Judge Napolitano's FreedomWatch w/ Sen Mike Lee @SenMikeLee … We just defeated the motion to table our Due Process Guarantee Act amendment. We are now one step closer to ensuring that American citizens may not be detained indefinitely when they are in the United States. In the next hour, the Senate will be voting on the Due Process Guarantee Act. I hope my fellow Senators will acknowledge the mistake Congress made in 2012 and vote not to table the amendment. Congress can take a stand for the Constitution by allowing a vote on the Due Process Guarantee Act, which corrects the mistake Congress made in 2012 and protects Americans from indefinite government detention.  … I’m on the Senate floor speaking on the need to allow votes on amendments like my due Process Guarantee Act. We are a deliberative body. We cannot deliberate while votes are held captive. I agree completely.

Read our full release here: … The right to freely practice religion is a priority for me as a Mormon, Utahn, and American. All people should be allowed to worship – or not worship – God in their own way.

That is why I support the Right to Try Act. Contact your Congressman about it today  Our federal land management agencies have drifted far from their intended purposes. We need to get back to managing federal lands as opposed to terrorizing the communities that surround them. … Peace in the Middle East will not be possible until all parties involved acknowledge Israel’s right to exist as a separate, independent state. #utpol … The only people that benefit from uncertainty in antitrust law are antitrust lawyers. Both businesses & consumers deserve clarity & certainty when it comes to federal antitrust law enforcement. The SMARTER Act would create a simpler & more equal system. … This morning I chatted with members of various business associations from across our great state during their DC visit. They exemplify #Utah’s state motto of “Industry” perfectly, and it was a neat way to start the day. #utpolpic.twitter.com/jP0Npmu1FG Once again, Utah comes out on top because of our great communities and business-friendly environment. Salt Lake City recently ranked as the best place to start a career. … We need to #MakeCongressWorkAgain.

Trump ordered a review of Bears Ears & Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments in Utah. This was a big step toward correcting Antiquities Act abuses & returning power to the states where it belongs; it was a big win for the people of Utah. #utpol Congress can--and must--make sure last month's omnibus spending monstrosity doesn't happen again. @SenMikeLee and I explain how at the @FDRLST. … pic.twitter.com/OzvdFdmpBk While the president should allow Robert Mueller to finish his investigation, passing legislation that limits his ability to fire Mueller is unconstitutional. My take here: … Last Saturday I attended Hamilton in SLC with these 3 great #Utah students who were winners in the New Nation letter writing competition. It was awesome to discuss our country's history and be in the room where it happened with these eager and engaged students.pic.twitter.com/xko9PrMV6h Last night in my #leetownhall access live event, a participant asked about my stance on the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act and my thoughts on special counsel Robert Mueller.

I look forward to seeing how the markup goes and hope for an opportunity to debate and amend something on the Senate floor. I've been outspoken on the need for the President to gain authorization from Congress before engaging in military action in Syria. During my access live event tonight, I explained why:pic.twitter.com/RJCCQOXVDn Join me tonight for our April Access Live event at 5:00pm MT by texting SenMikeLee to 828282, or by streaming the event live on either my Facebook page or here:   #utpol I sat down with @bdomenech yesterday afternoon to discuss the @JECRepublicans Social Capital Index, Syria, and other news of the day. You can listen to our discussion on what binds us together here. … I issued the following statement in response to a White House letter purporting to identify sufficient constitutional authority for Friday night’s attack in Syria:pic.twitter.com/Sn4Z41IPuI My thoughts and prayers are with the American service men and women in harms way tonight. I look forward to hearing from the President about his strategy for Syria and whether he plans to seek authorization from Congress for any further use of force. Great reporting by @grahamtoday on @JECRepublicans' new Social Capital Index. We are connected by far more than Facebook. … I released the following statement today regarding the evolving situation in Syria:pic.twitter.com/YmCffNDpxg The @JECRepublicans released an important and helpful tool today. It’s called the Social Capital Index and it measures the health of associational life in America on a state and county level - see where your state ranks! … .@SenMikeLee earned a #ACUFrating of 96% in 2017 and our Conservative Excellence Award! Thank you for your principled leadership and fighting for conservative values.pic.twitter.com/VC6QMQ9866 The use of chemical weapons absolutely requires a response from the United States. But if that response is going to include military force, the President of the United States should come to Congress and ask for authorization before military force is used. The @BudgetHawks analysis is spot on and highlights why I voted against this bill. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 busted spending caps, added to the deficit, and increased spending. We need to do better. … I am proud the Utah legislature unanimously passed and @GovHerbert signed the first 'free-range parenting' bill in the nation. I look forward to continuing to champion this issue on a national level … .@senmikelee on Spending Bill Process: ‘One of the Most Deeply Disturbing Things That I Experience’ as a Senator   via @cnsnews I had the opportunity to sit down and talk with @marklevinshow for his show on @FoxNews which aired last night. We had a great conversation about the omnibus spending bill, gun control, the constitution, and many other relevant topics … .@SenMikeLee: "The reason that we have fostered the development of the greatest civilization the world has ever known under the Constitution has been that to the degree we have followed the Constitution, it has kept our government focused on what government can do..."pic.twitter.com/MBTNNlNrIF I'm live with the @uvchamber and the @Lehiareachamber to discuss the wide range of issues that are impacting Utah County businesses:  … #utpol #leetownhall A small group of congressional leaders have negotiated a 2,232 page, $1.3 trillion bill to fund the government completely behind closed doors, giving Congress less than 48 hours to review it. I will absolutely be voting no.  … 2,232 pages. $1.3 trillion. 48 hours. The power to declare war belongs to Congress. By tabling this measure today, we have chosen yet again to abdicate our constitutional responsibility. If we choose in this moment to table this resolution we are making a choice to be willfully blind to the exercise of a power that belongs to us.  … This is a fast track process, this is really why the war power resolution matters here. It helps the Senate exercise it’s Article I Section 8 war power. 6/6 The war powers resolution provides us with the internal procedural mechanism for putting this up for a vote. This is a privileged motion, meaning we can get it brought to the floor and doesn’t require what we call cloture. 5/6 That doesn’t mean it (the War Power Resolution) is unconstitutional. It’s not. This is exactly what the Constitution contemplates. 4/6 Now, that’s not surprising because the whole purpose of the War Powers Resolution was to allow Congress to exercise its power to declare war, so presidents are naturally going to resist efforts to restrict and restrain their power. 3/6 The WSJ claims that the War Powers Resolution is somehow unconstitutional, citing no authority other than themselves and saying that presidents since then have regarded it as wrong or unconstitutional. 2/6 Some quick thoughts on @WSJopinion claims that the War Powers Resolution is unconstitutional: 1/6 With this resolution, Congress can reassert its constitutional role as the sole body responsible for authorizing when and where the U.S. can be engaged in hostilities. Proud to co-sponsor this important legislation along with @SenSanders, @SenMikeLee, @ChrisMurphyCT and others. DoD Sec. Mattis: "Neither President Obama nor President Trump authorized the use of U.S. military force against the Houthis." Yet U.S. provides intelligence sharing, mid-air refueling, & targeting assistance to Saudis to bomb Houthis. Unconstitutional! #SJRes54 #ampFW @SenMikeLee I will be speaking on SJ Res 54 from the Senate floor in 10 minutes. It's time for Congress to reassert its Article 1 war powers. You can watch here:  … Utah @SenMikeLee is speaking out in anticipation of the newest Congressional spending bill. "Bailing out Obamacare’s fundamental failures only puts the real goal further out of reach,” Lee said. … Thank you, @SenMikeLee for standing up for our Constitution by leading on S.J. Res. 54! Congress must debate & authorize putting our servicemembers in harms way! #TeaParty “If the Pentagon insists on perpetuating a senseless, unauthorized war first launched by President Obama…to appease Saudi Arabia, the White House must persuade majorities of the House and Senate to approve of U.S. hostilities against Yemen’s Houthis.“ … As the omnibus vote approaches this week, please read this op-ed from @SenTedCruz, @SenMikeLee, @Jim_Jordan, and myself.  It would be unacceptable to bail out Obamacare with billions in new spending. Republicans should reject this proposal. … I couldn’t agree with @ChrisMurphyCT more. It’s time for us to end our involvement in this unauthorized war. … .@tedcruz, @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and I agree: doubling down in support of Obamacare bailouts will not work. We need to treat health insurance as the product it is. Consumer freedom is the most effective way to make health insurance more affordable. … I sat down with John Hines of @OANN to discuss @SenSanders, @ChrisMurphyCT and my resolution calling for Congress to take back its authority to declare war and vote on whether our military involvement in Yemen is warranted. You can watch it here: … The Constitution gives Congress the ability to declare war, & Congress needs to re-assert itself in this role & vote whether or not our military should be involved in Yemen. Watch as @ChrisMurphyCT, @SenSanders & I discuss this issue on the Senate floor.  … You can watch live as I discuss the numbers behind the opioid crisis @AEI, happening now:  It was great talking to @FreedomWorks yesterday about how competition can be used to lower drug prices. … President Trump won the election  after promising to reevaluate our nation’s foreign policy priorities. This resolution opens up the door for President Trump to do that reevaluation now, hand-in-hand with Congress. … Tomorrow I will be at @AEI discussing the causes behind the opioid epidemic. While economic factors play a part, @JECRepublicans research shows that social factors may actually play a larger role. … Every year I compile a report highlighting the work my staff and I have done on behalf of the people of Utah in order to be transparent and accountable.

Congress needs to re-engage in the tariff process, which is why I’ve introduced the Global Trade Accountability Act. … .@SenSanders, @ChrisMurphyCT and I introduced a joint resolution yesterday calling for a vote on American military actions in Yemen under the War Powers Act.

That child deserves the right to choose life. #TheyFeelPain Right now, the United States is just one of seven countries in the world that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.
