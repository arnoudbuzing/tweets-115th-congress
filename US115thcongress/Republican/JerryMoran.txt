We respect and admire the courage of our law enforcement as they work to make this state a safer place, and we grieve the loss of a dedicated public servant. It was an honor to be with AG Sessions and Kansas law enforcement officials today. I’m appreciative of his efforts to make Kansas safer, and I welcome the two grants he announced for our state. More: … Today, I am hosting Attorney General Jeff Sessions in Kansas as he tours @KLETC and gives remarks to our law enforcement personnel. Watch the remarks live at 2:45 p.m. CT: … On Monday I was in Manhattan with DHS @SecNielsen, @SenPatRoberts, @GovJeffColyer, @RepKevinYoder and @RepMarshall to tour NBAF and receive an update on the construction of the facility. More on this visit from the @MercNewsroom: … Thank you for those who watched the #LandonLecture. As I stated in my remarks, I’m committed to making certain we #NeverForget 9/11 and how it refocused us as a nation on the things that bind us together rather than pull us apart. God Bless America today and everyday. May we #NeverForget September 11th, 2001. May we Never Forget the way we united in the aftermath of the attacks, as one nation under God. And may we renew our commitment to respecting one another, to working together for the common good and answering the call to serve. As I stood next to a New York City congressman from Brooklyn, we saw a nation under attack. While we disagree with each other more often than not, as we stood there, we saw each other as fathers, not foes; fellow Americans, not political enemies. #LandonLecture Her concern for me on that day and her efforts to make sure it was she who told our daughters their father was safe, rather than the television, is representative of a larger sacrifice that my family has made in order for me to continue to answer the calls of many. #LandonLecture One of the most important calls I took that day was from my wife, Robba. Before widely used cell phones, texting and email, she had no way to reach me besides calling my main office line. I felt the care and compassion of Kansans in ways that I had not before, and I am forever changed. #LandonLecture On this day, the most frightening day our nation has seen in this lifetime, Kansans chose to pick up the phone and offer their assistance, their thoughts and their prayers. Earlier, I spoke about remaining in my office and answering Kansans’ telephone calls on September 11th.  Now, let me tell you what Kansans called to say: they called to ask how they could support their fellow Americans, how they could help. As we now reflect on Senator McCain’s vast contributions to our nation, I intend to continue advancing his work and making certain veterans are treated with the dignity and respect they have earned and that they receive the benefits they were promised. #LandonLecture The world recently mourned the passing of my friend Senator John McCain. He was an honorable man and exemplified what it means to be a great American. He used his bully-pulpit for good and allowed the injustices he’d seen throughout his life to guide his work. #LandonLecture For as long as I’ve been in Congress, I’ve been explaining, “where I come from, economic development can often be whether or not there is a grocery store in town.” #LandonLecture I was walking through the area where the Twin Towers once stood. Memorials had been created there among the dust and rubble, where loved ones could pay their respects. #LandonLecture A few days after the September 11th attacks, I was part of the first congressional delegation to visit Ground Zero in New York City. #LandonLecture I hope today to convey to the students in this room – to the next generation of engineers, mathematicians, pilots, astronauts, scientists – Kansas needs you. #LandonLecture From drones to NBAF and everything in-between, industry and research need young people, and young people need opportunities. #LandonLecture Plain and simple: Canadian and Mexican markets are vital to our state and both countries need to be part of a final NAFTA agreement. #LandonLecture We ought to continue working to improve pre-existing trade deals, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, and re-engaging in others, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. #LandonLecture Tough enforcement of trade rules is a good idea, especially when it comes to dealing with China, but a trade war is not. #LandonLecture But I’m also going to discuss how we should “never forget” how we came together as a country to help one another after that horrific day 17 years ago. #LandonLecture Today, I am going to speak to you about how 9/11 changed me as a legislator and the issues I have been called to help solve in order to make a difference in Kansas and our country. #LandonLecture determined to tackle every problem I could, to seize every moment of every day to fight for not only those who were sent into harm’s way, but for our farmers, our ranchers, our teachers, our veterans, and our way of life. #LandonLecture As Kansans returned to work and profoundly demonstrated that they would not be held hostage by fear, I returned to work as your representative with a new fire, a new passion and a new sense of purpose, In a new way, I had a duty not only to preserve the Kansas way of life that I cared so much about, but the American way of life. #LandonLecture This day 17 years ago changed me – the way I viewed public service and advocated for Kansans and our country. It broadened my prospective and deepened my resolve. #LandonLecture I stood side-by-side with Chuck and we turned on the television in time to witness a second airplane crash into the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Immediately, we concluded: “This can’t be an accident.” #LandonLecture I had just finished my regular morning workout when, with my colleague from New York, then-Representative @ChuckSchumer, we first heard reports of a plane crashing into a high-rise building in New York City. #LandonLecture This morning at @KState, I’ll deliver the 178th Landon Lecture to share my story of September 11, 2001 and how that day broadened my perspective and changed me as a legislator. Use #LandonLecture to follow along and engage in today's discussion.

See more:pic.twitter.com/SUXpEF7bC1 Trade and exports are how we earn a living in Kansas. The effects of the current tariffs are real and farmers, ranchers and our nation’s manufacturing industry cannot afford a trade war. Any further escalation of the trade dispute with China that results in more tariffs will only cause harm to families, farmers, manufacturers, workers, consumers and businesses – the very people and industries that USTR is supposed to help succeed. The tactics we see now – where the United States imposes tariffs, China responds, the United States threatens more tariffs, China responds and so forth – appear to have gotten China’s attention, but more tariffs cannot be the ultimate answer. While I applaud the administration’s efforts to crack down on China’s unfair trade practices, I’m questioning Ambassador Lighthizer on the administration’s tactics and strategy regarding how it is negotiating with China.

My full statement on today’s Helsinki summit press conference:pic.twitter.com/pKIiNJ5m4G This summit, and my meetings with Russian officials in Moscow, did nothing to suggest we should roll back sanctions and reaffirmed that Congress must continue to hold Russia accountable. Putin is not our friend; he’s an adversary intent on continuing Russia’s disruptive activities, including meddling in our own democratic process. I hope the president makes clear to Putin that sanctions against Russia will be lifted only if their behavior changes & that our NATO alliance is strong as we work together against Russian attempts to undermine world stability.

We should be working with our allies to isolate China rather than escalate a trade war. Kansans agree with the president that steps ought to be taken to address China's misconduct. As I've repeatedly indicated to the president and administration officials, I remain unconvinced that tariffs are the best tool to change China's bad behavior. I commend the McCurry Brothers of Kansas as they celebrate 90 years of producing quality Angus cattle. This milestone is important as we continue to work to create an environment where this kind of success can be duplicated for generations to come. … Independence Day is a special holiday in our country as we come together to celebrate our nation’s founding.

This is the result of years of preparation from the @22ARW, 931st and the civilians on #TeamMcConnell. Good news for Wichita! … Introduced the Keep Families Together & Enforce the Law Act. This bill would #KeepFamiliesTogether during legal proceedings, protect children, authorize 225 more immigration judges & ensure the integrity of our immigration laws. Whatever one’s views are on fixing our broken immigration system, no child – especially a child with Down syndrome – should be mocked. This response does not align with our values as Americans and does not contribute to our efforts to end the current circumstances. … Great to meet with @AlzAssociation today during its 2018 Advocacy Forum.

Beautiful country and squarely in the Heartland of our great nation.pic.twitter.com/rbepVdgxLq Thanks to the Mertz family for hosting today's Ag Town Hall, talking about what's important to agriculture in Kansas with @SecretarySonny @SenPatRoberts and @JerryMoran . #GrowKansas #GrowAgpic.twitter.com/pb3Ycx1Giv Today at 2:30 PM EDT, @SecretarySonny will join  @SenPatRoberts and Senator @JerryMoran in an agriculture discussion panel. Listen Live:   (Live stream courtesy of @WIBWNews)pic.twitter.com/tz3kiEa9hY Live now. … Tune in this afternoon at 1:30 (Central) for a Kansas Agriculture Roundup. I'll join @SenPatRoberts and Sen. @JerryMoran at River Creek Farms near Manhattan, KS. Moderated by @GregAkagi on @WIBWNews.  Listen live here:  pic.twitter.com/YVugsNJPO3 Today and every day, we thank God for the heroes we have been given and recognize the debt of gratitude we owe them. Happy #MemorialDay.pic.twitter.com/C1bICKDRuo In my Commerce, Justice, Science & Related Agencies subcommittee hearing, I expressed to @JimBridenstine my objection to @NASA's FY19 budget request to close its education office given the impact this proposal would have on NASA’s #STEM education role → … This is a big deal for veterans... Say goodbye to the arbitrary 30-day/40-mile Veterans' Choice eligibility requirements. #CompletetheMISSION … I applaud the Senate for passing the #VAMISSIONAct, which includes major reforms I cosponsored with @JerryMoran to expand health care choices for veterans & transform the VA into an integrated 21st century health care system  … I’m proud the Senate overwhelmingly supported the #VAMISSIONAct that empowers our veterans and provides our nation’s heroes with the timely and quality healthcare they deserve. With Memorial Day approaching, I look forward to @POTUS signing this bill into law.pic.twitter.com/9r8Phx6nka  We’re working hard to foster innovation within the VA. This bill creates the VA Center for Innovation, allowing the VA to develop and carry out pilot programs to explore innovative approaches to improving care, access to care and cost of care to better assist our veterans.pic.twitter.com/PrEvACFjBz  The VA is known as a high-quality provider of telemedicine, but the opportunity to expand that – especially for rural veterans or veterans needing specialty care – is one that I am pleased we incorporated into the #VAMISSIONAct.pic.twitter.com/9NrpI8klmk  The #VAMISSIONAct provides additional funds to maintain the Veterans' Choice Program during the development and implementation of the new Community Care Program and removes the barrier between Choice-specific funds and other community care funds.pic.twitter.com/08JN9HUCec  Walk-in care is becoming more common. This legislation allows our veterans to receive care from local walk-in clinics, convenient-care clinics & federally-funded health centers, giving veterans the same access to non-emergent convenience care in the community as non-veterans.pic.twitter.com/yZwcqIAuQt  Representing a rural state, I am pleased the #VAMISSIONAct requires community care be paid for at critical access hospital designation Medicare rates, encouraging our rural hospitals to accept veterans into their community care program. More information ↓pic.twitter.com/n6XHL2uvvm  #VAMISSIONAct requires market area assessments to determine where VA care is available in the community & where it excels. These assessments will provide Congress a better understanding of redundancies & what kind of care is in the best interest of the veteran.pic.twitter.com/kkzLpIsMyV  Too often veterans must return to the VA every time they need treatment stemming from the original purpose of seeking care in the community. This legislation cuts red tape by making certain an entire episode of care is treated to completion in the community. More ↓pic.twitter.com/dX3CVzZYac  Veterans will now have the ability to appeal a decision made by the VA if they believe their VA provider is wrongly denying them access to community care – giving the veteran an additional option for recourse and putting their care decisions back in their own hands.pic.twitter.com/Et9GF0WHej  The #VAMISSIONAct reforms community care eligibility – a big win for veterans. This legislation replaces the existing, arbitrary 30-day/40-mile eligibility requirements with simply what is in the best interest of the veteran.pic.twitter.com/DejwUqWfvS  This legislation requires the VA to provide veterans a coordinator of care when they choose to utilize care in their community to ensure continuity of care and service in a timely manner, making it easier for a veteran to receive the care they need.pic.twitter.com/pB79tmTfqI  There are seven different community care programs within the VA where veterans can access care outside of the VA. These programs are consolidated into one under the #VAMISSIONAct, reducing bureaucracy and making the program easier for veterans and their providers.pic.twitter.com/NDbkVtplTT  #VAMISSIONAct makes certain the VA executes the law consistent with the intent of Congress as it develops rules & regulations to govern the new Choice program – preventing the VA from narrowing & limiting the program's ability to serve veterans as we intend & they deserve.pic.twitter.com/RXtcTlaUh4 I spoke on the Senate floor in support of the #VAMISSIONAct – I am grateful for @SenJohnMcCain’s leadership on this reform effort and have enjoyed working alongside him to do right by our veterans. 12 reasons why we must #CompleteTheMISSION: This is a good day for justice in our state. We must continue to reject hatred that imperils the safety and morals of our communities. I remain inspired by Alok Madasani and Ian Grillot’s courage and am saying a prayer for Srinivas Kuchibhotla’s family. … Joined colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce The FARMERS FIRST Act to reestablish the Farm & Ranch Stress Assistance Network, among other important provisions. We must continue working to equip farmers with mental health resources they need. … It is time for us to #CompletetheMISSION and pass #VAMISSIONAct. It is more than appropriate to honor those who served our country at this point in May, in which Memorial Day is around the corner, to provide the care that they are asking for.pic.twitter.com/qyfijbDa1v Questioning @FBI Director Christopher Way on department's FY2019 budget request in my Senate Appropriations Subcommittee.

Make sure to shop local and thank a Kansas farmer or rancher during #NationalBeefMonth for working year-round to get food to our tables.pic.twitter.com/xv42EBv0b1 Recent comments denigrating my friend and colleague @SenJohnMcCain are reprehensible. Whatever one’s differences with John, he’s a patriot who has served our nation selflessly and honorably and deserves our respect. We are grateful for all of the military spouses whose sacrifices to protect our freedom too often go unnoticed. Thank you for your contributions to our military bases, our communities and our country. #MilitarySpouseAppreciationDaypic.twitter.com/A499yUyDuG I reiterated to @SecAzar today the importance of increased @NIH funding. NIH researchers are working to find ways to delay the onset of Alzheimer’s, cure cancer and reduce diabetes, and sustaining funding for NIH should remain a @HHSGov priority.pic.twitter.com/okvEMnmhsB Thank you for visiting with @SenBlumenthal and me, and for educating us as we work to protect future generations of athletes. … .@US_EDA also provides small but valuable investments for economically distressed areas to spur development and support job creation. I look forward to hearing more about future plans for EDA programs to continue our growth.  … Critical to America's competitiveness & growth is @US_EDA within @CommerceGov, which bolsters communities by maximizing local talent & incentivizing institutions to innovate & create jobs. These programs are particularly important to Kansans interested in business development. Many rural communities are unable to fully access broadband because they live in either under-served or un-served areas. I inquired about how @CommerceGov is working to address #digitaldivide and how its FY19 request will further support broadband expansion efforts.

You continue to inspire me each and every day, and I can’t wait to hear about what you will accomplish next. Best wishes! … This week, @POTUS signed my bill that commemorates the sacrifices made by educators who have lost their lives while working with students. The memorial, located at @emporiastate, recognizes fallen educators' unrelenting dedication to their students. … Calling in to @weatherchannel at 5:40pm CT to discuss potential severe weather in KS this week. … As the nation seeks to continue its mission of closing the Digital Divide by bringing high-speed broadband access to rural America, I look forward to seeing Kansas maintain its leadership role as a telecommunications and technology destination for industry and workforce. As the Chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the welfare of consumers, including enforcement of certain mergers and acquisitions, I plan to closely monitor developments beyond this announcement. .@Sprint has been a vital source of economic development and jobs in the Kansas City area for many years, and I urge the new company's leadership from the recently announced merger with @TMobile to continue growing and innovating in Kansas. … Do you have any leftover prescription drugs listed below? Clean out your medicine cabinets today on National Prescription Drug #TakeBackDay and safely dispose of unused prescription drugs. We can help protect our families and prevent #opioid addiction. Thank you for having me! … Tomorrow, on National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, we can help prevent #opioid addiction by safely disposing of unused prescription drugs. Last #TakeBackDay, Americans collected 900,000 pounds of prescription drugs – more than the weight of three Boeing 757s combined. Kansans are proud to have Mike Pompeo serve as Secretary of State & I look forward to working with him in his new role. @POTUS’ trust in him will be instrumental to our nation’s diplomatic engagement & he will be an effective advocate for America's interests. About to go live w/ @OutnumberedOT on @FoxNews. Tune in!pic.twitter.com/wWp3f8o0Qg – bei United States Capitol Building .@Wheatland385 fourth-graders chatted with @JerryMoran this morning about representing Kansas. Teacher @Todd_Flory was even in Sen. Moran's office for the call. Students had great questions!pic.twitter.com/4RLEScrWSb This is a tough job and the VA needs strong leadership. The VA & members of Congress must be singularly focused on prioritizing veterans above all else, moving quickly to pass Choice reform and upholding an unquestionable commitment to service and providing quality care. This critical position must be filled promptly. The person who becomes our next secretary of the VA will have a direct impact on the well-being of nearly 200,000 Kansans and millions of veterans across the country. I have a very high standard for the individual who runs the VA, and I appreciated the discussion I had with Rear Admiral Jackson regarding his vision for the department. However, I respect his decision to withdraw from consideration. According to @CDCgov, #opioid overdoses are #1 cause of accidental death in the US – 115 people every day die from opioid-related causes. Asked AG Sessions to reaffirm @TheJusticeDept commitment to ending this epidemic during my subcommittee hearing today. … My thanks to AG Sessions for joining our subcommittee today as @TheJusticeDept begins its work on the FY19 budget. Tune in live:  … I look forward to hearing @TheJusticeDept's plans for #FixNICS & #StopSchoolViolenceAct implementation and ways the department plans to reduce violent crime and combat transnational criminal organizations. In Garden City, Kan., @TheJusticeDept successfully investigated & convicted individuals who conspired to bomb Somali immigrants. @FBI & local law enforcement's coordination should be a model for future federal & local partnerships. Arguably, @TheJusticeDept's greatest responsibilities include keeping Americans safe & upholding the rule of law. This requires that Congress adequately & appropriately fund our nation’s law enforcement efforts, including counterterrorism & cybersecurity initiatives. HAPPENING NOW: AG Jeff Sessions is presenting @TheJusticeDept's FY19 budget request to my Senate Appropriations Subcommittee. Tune in live:  …pic.twitter.com/Il098bONbN .@SenBlumenthal and I will continue to work with these athletes as our investigation progresses to make certain their testimonies are used to protect the next generation looking to achieve success representing our nation. … Watch live now: first @SenateCommerce subcommittee hearing on Olympic abuse investigation. … Barbara Bush was a kind and gracious person who had the ability to make her views known and respected. She was a First Lady who made immense contributions to our nation and made Americans proud. May she rest in peace. Good news → Senate just voted to begin consideration of my bill with @SenToomey to reverse overreaching @CFPB rule to return a sense of stability to the auto marketplace & provide a path to lower costs for all car purchasers. … The Senate is voting now to move to legislation from @JerryMoran and me to undo @CFPB’s illegal effort to regulate car loans:   This bill would rightfully restore the sovereign status of tribal governments and once again allow tribal governments, elected by their members, to possess the right to make informed decisions on behalf of those they represent. I urge my colleagues to support its passage. … "The @USGAO took its time but on Dec. 5 confirmed that the auto-lender guidance is a rule under CRA . . . Jerry Moran has introduced a repeal resolution, and we’re told Senate leaders will make that vote a priority." @WSJopinion on auto-lending relief: … On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember the six million Jews who lost their lives & recommit to sharing stories of the Holocaust so that our children & grandchildren will #NeverAgain allow this tragedy to be repeated. … “Kansas exported more than $4.5B worth of agricultural products, which supported more than 36K jobs and generated more than $5.7B in economic activity, making trade negotiations all the more important.” - @JerryMoran  Met with @POTUS at WH ag & trade meeting today and shared a photo I took in Kensington of grain sitting idle on the ground waiting for mouths to feed. With 20+ million people facing famine globally, let's get food to tables now.pic.twitter.com/R4JFHFn4jT Stressed to @SecretarySonny that we need more markets for farmers. With stockpiles of grain sitting on the ground ready and waiting to feed hungry people around the world, we need more trade, not less, to keep Kansas farms alive.pic.twitter.com/P9RBxlVJwC Appreciated @facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's @SenateCommerce testimony yesterday. Words are important, but actions are even more important. I look forward to seeing how Facebook implements its plans to protect user data & privacy moving forward. … I want Kansas to be a place where individuals who are interested in and love science and mathematics and engineering have not only a place to receive an education and training, but a place to pursue a career and raise a family. … I'm grateful to have served as MilCon/VA Senate Appropriations Subcommittee chairman and am proud of the investments we've made in the quality of life for our military families and veterans in this capacity.  More on our accomplishments & what's next: … Honored to be selected chairman of Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice & Science, providing an opportunity to prioritize funding for investments in our nation’s infrastructure, economic development, public safety, aerospace initiatives, @NSF, @NASA & more. Live on @BloombergTV now discussing #Facebook hearing.pic.twitter.com/PjIi5tH9Tx Going live with @BloombergTV’s @emilychangtv at 1:50pm ET to discuss @Facebook hearing and how we can best protect consumer data in this technology era. Tune in! We can’t make it rain or dictate prices, but through sound policies, especially on trade, our nation can better respond to the disaster in farm country and improve the livelihoods of American farmers and ranchers. … My hope is this is a negotiating tactic, but the efforts we see now suggest more than that, as they keep being ramped up by both countries: the United States imposes tariffs, China responds. The United States imposes tariffs, China responds. And so on. … Tough enforcement of trade rules is a good idea, especially when it comes to dealing with China, but a trade war is not. My op-ed in @TheHill: … Kansas has a rich aviation history. Thank you, @GarminAviation, for continuing to choose Kansas as your home. Was honored to participate in #GAMARally today. … Seth is an inspiration to us all – glad you were able to meet him today, @UnderSecArmy, @ArmyChiefStaff and @VCSA_PAO. … We do need more women in STEM.

Read more in my @KCStar editorial here: … It is concerning that allegations of privatizing @DeptVetAffairs healthcare are being used as a distraction from the VA’s solemn responsibility to support those the VA was created to serve. This false narrative diverts attention from the very real problems that persist at the VA. "The @DeptVetAffairs should remain a primary and important part of veterans’ lives... However, we must not turn our back on the 1.6 million veterans who want and need Choice and those who rely on access to care in their community or risk not having access to care at all." … Veterans deserve a @DeptVetAffairs worthy of their sacrifice, which requires leadership at the top that is focused on changing VA bureaucracy. Read more about the kind of VA leadership needed for our veterans in my @KCStarOpinion: … “The best bill before Congress is Mr. Moran’s with Senator John McCain.” More on how my bill with @SenJohnMcCain is the right choice to reform @DeptVetAffairs, via @WSJopinion: … Trade is imperative to Kansans’ livelihood.

As we raise awareness of and prepare for future #wildfires, I remain committed to seeing this legislation signed into law. Upon introduction of our bills, Kansans shared their stories about how this legislation would ease the burden on Kansas farmers & ranchers in future disasters & improve recovery programs. … Following the widespread fires – the largest in our state's history – I introduced a series of bills with @RepMarshall to improve and reform programs Kansas farmers and ranchers rely on in times of natural disaster. … Last March, a number of counties in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas were severely damaged by ongoing wildfires that destroyed homes and fences, killing thousands of cattle, and claiming the lives of seven people. This week marks #WildfireAwarenessWeek – a good reminder to do everything we can to prevent and fight wildfires, which Kansans know from experience can have a devastating impact on our homes, our families and our communities.

While we appreciate the efforts by USOC to establish the US Center for Safe Sport, it is obvious that additional measures need to be taken to prevent similarly heinous crimes from occurring in the future, while ensuring appropriate reporting in the unfortunate event that they do. Of particular concern is the recent allegation that @USAGym actively sought to silence at least one Olympic gymnast with a non-disclosure agreement. @SenBlumenthal & I want to know: How was this justified? Who was aware of this NDA? Is this common practice? Larry Nassar’s despicable actions are well documented; however, recent revelations from his sentencing hearings provide ample evidence that @USAGym & @michiganstateu were negligent in acting on reports of this abuse. This week, Larry Nassar was sentenced to 40+ years for sexually abusing over 150 young women. @SenBlumenthal & I are demanding answers from @USAGym, U.S. Olympic Committee & @michiganstateu regarding their systemic failures & their plans to protect athletes from sexual abuse.pic.twitter.com/Urmji202Wc .@govsambrownback has long demonstrated his commitment to promoting the freedom of all to practice the religion of their choice.
