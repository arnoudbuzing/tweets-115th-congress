Judge Kavanaugh will have my support and my vote to confirm him to the Supreme Court. His views on due process and mens rea show a thoughtful approach to the law and its applications. His views on war powers and separation of powers are encouraging. On issues such as property rights and reining in the administrative state, Judge Kavanaugh has a strong record and showed a deep commitment during our meeting. My conversation with Judge Kavanaugh reinforces my belief that he will evaluate cases before the Supreme Court from a textual and originalist point of view. I believe he will carefully adhere to the Constitution and will take his job to protect individual liberty seriously. Of course, my vote is not a single-issue vote, and much of my reading and conversation has been in trying to figure out exactly how good Judge Kavanaugh will be on other issues before the Court. In reviewing his record on other privacy cases like Jones, and through my conversation with him, I have hope that in light of the new precedent in Carpenter v. United States, Judge Kavanaugh will be more open to a Fourth Amendment that protects digital records and property. I have expressed my concern over Judge Kavanaugh’s record on warrantless bulk collection of data and how that might apply to very important privacy cases before the Supreme Court. After meeting Judge Kavanaugh and reviewing his record, I have decided to support his nomination. No one will ever completely agree with a nominee (unless of course, you are the nominee). Each nominee however, must be judged on the totality of their views character and opinions.

It's time for Republicans to step up the plate and vote for what they say they're for: a balanced budget. Spending and waste is out of control. How moronic are we to keep flushing tax payer money down a rathole in Afghanistan? When republicans become the majority there is no conservative party. What I'm asking for today is to cut one penny from every dollar in spending.  “Senator Rand Paul Introduces His Penny Plan Budget” … To those highlighting my vote for tax cuts: allowing Americans to keep more of their own money is what republicans should be for.

If the government ran a balanced budget we would have a stronger, safer nation. If we want to secure our nation we need to make sure we have a sound economy. Republicans say we are for devolving spending and limited government and yet why won't they vote for a budget that balances? I've put forward a Penny Plan budget that cuts spending by 1%. Couldn't we cut one penny from every dollar? Isn't there enough government waste to cut? The budget that republicans passed last year had entitlement reform. Did they do anything to enact those reforms? No. No one lifted a finger to do anything about entitlement spending. It's a canard. When we have a vote on my balanced budget in a minute we'll see republicans saying oh my we can't cut spending. They're only for spending restraint in theory. Dems and Republicans make an unholy alliance. Republicans get more military spending and dems get more welfare spending. We've got guns and butter everyone gets what they want but the tax payer. There is a point which debt is too cumbersome...We have a national debt of $21 trillion dollars. Currently the debt ceiling has been raised and the government can spend and borrow as much as they want. Right now, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), chairman of the Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management (FSO) Subcommittee, is speaking on the U.S. Senate floor to urge support for his “Penny Plan” balanced budget:  … Your Senator should be voting to balance the budget! This is a way to do it! This is a litmus test for all Republicans! You either vote for fiscal responsibility and a balanced budget, or you continue to spend endlessly! Vote for the penny plan or stop calling yourself a fiscal conservative! … Enjoyed meeting @RandPaul’s summer intern class!pic.twitter.com/Sd3ui4c2vb This budget vote will be a litmus test for Republicans who claim to be conservative, but are only too happy to grow the federal government and increase our debt. … Club for Growth urges a "YES" vote on @RandPaul's "Penny Plan" balanced budget.

I urge @SenFeinstein to stand against her nomination too! America is a great beacon of hope to the world. We must model freedom. We should not put advocates of torture in charge of our institutions. We can and must do better to helm the CIA. In what seemed like a miracle, the city of Warsaw lit up like a blinking Christmas tree. These freedom fighters were seeking freedom, freedom FROM torture, not freedom TO torture. When two amateur radio operators risked their lives to illegally launch Radio Solidarity in Poland in 1982, they were unsure how big their movement was, so they asked listenteners to blink their lights if they were listening. Torture is the hallmark of totalitarianism Torture is not who we are as a people. America has always been that shining hope of liberty. People around the world look to America want freedom from torture NOT freedom to torture. Tune in to @CNN and @FaceTheNation this morning to hear more of this discussion. … Looking forward to joining @jaketapper on @CNN and @margbrennan on @CBSNews tomorrow am.

Yet now he picks for Secretary of State and CIA Director people who embody them, defend them, and, I’m afraid, will repeat them. I will not support their nominations. I will continue to support President @realDonaldTrump, but I can’t support people who never understood America First and want to manipulate the President into the sphere of the neocons who never met a war they didn’t want to star in. Director Pompeo has not learned the lessons of regime change and wants regime change in Iran. What I liked about candidate Trump was his strong condemnation of the Iraq War. I believe President Trump has done a great job, and I continue to support him, but I cannot endorse his nomination of people who loved the Iraq War so much that they want an Iran War next.

Rand Paul: "Congress is full of hypocrites. I took a stand."  Make no mistake, I will always stand up for fiscal responsibility, regardless of which party is in power, and I will continue to call the Republican Party home to the ideas that led to Americans trusting us with government in the first place. Tonight, you could feel the frustration and embarrassment growing in Congress as we exposed the hypocrisy of Republicans who are joining in an unholy alliance and spending free-for-all with Democrats at the expense of the American people and our party’s supposed principles. "Are we to be conservative all the time or only when we're in the minority?" says @RandPaul, distilling this whole debate to a sentence. Sen.

But you have to ask yourself whether a $20 trillion debt makes us a stronger country or a weaker country. I'm asking for one amendment.  It takes fifteen minutes. Yes, we should have debate.  Yes, we should have a vote. Let's have a vote tonight on amendments. They say, "It's a binary choice, young man. Take it or leave it." Well, I'll leave it.

Like why we blew up the last Libyan government...and, wait, there’s a Libyan government currently? We spent $8.2 million to “instill confidence in the Libyan government”. Oh great, now the waste report is going to get a subpoena from the Special Prosecutor. We spent over $170k to build trails in national parks. Seems like not too bad until you read the next line that the parks were in Russia It may not seem like a lot of money, but we spent just under $100k to make sure Kenyan farmers knew how to use Facebook. They spent $324,015 to pay for a clown school in Argentina. Rumors to the contrary, this was not a CODEL Your government spent $3,217,960 on putting on music festival and concerts abroad. Here are just a handful of the examples...#AiringofGrievances That’s roughly the size of my hometown of Bowling Green, Kentucky The average taxpayer pays around $8,136.
