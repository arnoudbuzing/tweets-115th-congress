In 2014, the number of babies born drug-dependent had increased by 500 percent since 2000 In 2015, there were 52,404 drug overdose deaths — 33,091 of those deaths, almost two-thirds, involved the use of opioids. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Since 2000, over 300,000 Americans have died from overdoses involving opioids. In 2016, more than two million Americans had an addiction to prescription or illicit opioids. The opioid crisis has destroyed too many families across our country. We must work together to end this epidemic. It was an active discussion with @realDonaldTrump & my Republican colleagues today. Mr. President, A+.
