Today, we will hear specifically from additional three states who, based upon my review of the plans, have also taken advantage of the flexibility we encouraged under the law to design innovative plans. Last October, this Committee held a hearing to hear from the State education chiefs in three states, Tennessee, Louisiana, and New Mexico, that were among the best at making the most of the new law by designing innovative plans. Under #ESSA, in order to receive over $18 billion in annual federal funding, states have the chance to design their own State plan that includes setting academic goals for students, measuring schools’ performance, and deciding how to fix failing schools. Today, I hope to hear how Nebraska, South Carolina, and Delaware are taking advantage of that opportunity. The Every Student Succeeds Act gave Tennessee, in @Mrs_C_Hines’ words, “a real opportunity for our state to build on the progress we’ve made and enact change, particularly in traditionally-underserved communities.” The consensus this Committee reached was: Continue the law’s important measurements of academic progress of students but restore to states what to do about that progress. Reaching the point of fixing No Child Left Behind took seven years of Congressional efforts, 27 hearings, and a three day markup where this Committee considered 57 amendments. Mrs. Hines: “ESSA empowers Tennessee with the responsibility to decide how to close achievement gaps, improve schools and make sure that all our children succeed.” Mrs. Hines: “Unlike the previous federal education law, No Child Left Behind, #ESSA gives Tennessee more autonomy to design policies to meet the needs of our state’s students.” Candace Hines, a kindergarten teacher in Memphis, recently wrote in the @memphisnews: “This year, Tennessee schools will begin to implement our state’s new education plan under the Every Student Succeeds Act (#ESSA).” HAPPENING NOW … The Every Student Succeeds Act, which I introduced in the Senate, put states back in the driver’s seat to make decisions on how to help their students, and I am eager to see what this new chapter holds for our nation’s students.

The president has already signed into law two consecutive bills that provide record funding for science, technology, energy and biomedical research, and this legislation will build on that. The pkg also includes the 4th straight year of record funding in a regular appropriations bill for biomedical research at the @NIH. As a result of investing in our biomedical research, we will have access to more life-changing treatments and cures, and see more medical miracles. Today, the U.S. Senate passed an appropriations package that provides $3.8 billion to help fight the opioid crisis, bringing the total amount approved by the Senate this year to $8.5 billion. #OpioidCrisisResponse  … In the @WashTimes: “The lopsided 99-1 vote underscored the depth of the drug-overdose crisis that’s hammering every corner of the U.S. and resulted in 72,000 deaths in 2017, nearly 49,000 of which were from opioids.” #OpioidCrisisResponse … "Opioids are our most serious public health epidemic," said Sen.

Congrats to @UTKnoxville for receiving a $1.5M federal grant from @ARPA-E to develop fuel cells that could someday produce electricity. #AmericaFirst In an age when you can compare different prices and check a dozen reviews when shopping for a new BBQ grill, Americans should be able to know the cost of their health care. While the private sector is largely leading the charge on making health care information more easily available, the federal government can also play a role to help patients, and witnesses today can inform Congress about steps we can take. As patients have shopped around for Lasik, the price started to dramatically decrease – it has gone down 75 percent over the last 15 years, according to @RandPaul. .@RandPaul has talked about how, with an elective surgery such as Lasik, a patient is more likely to call doctors’ offices to find the best price, calling an average of four different doctors to find the best price for the corrective eye surgery. Today’s hearing is an opportunity to learn how we can improve what information is easily available about the cost and quality of health care, so patients can make the best health care decisions for them, their families, and their wallets. This is true for everything else but not for health care – the cost of health care has remained in a black box. The Internet has made it easier for consumers to know more about what they want to purchase before they actually buy it. You can easily read an online review and compare prices for everything from a coffee maker to a new car. After using a website that compiled typical prices for medical care, he learned the same test would have cost just $550 in a doctor’s office. @SecAzar said that consumers are so in the dark they often feel “powerless.” .@SecAzar recently told the story of his doctor ordering a routine echo cardio stress test. He was sent down the street and admitted to the hospital, where, after considerable effort on his part, he learned the test would cost him $3,500. As any American, even @SecAzar, knows, it can be very difficult to find out how much a simple health care test will cost, before a doctor’s visit.

In 2014, I voted to confirm President Barack Obama’s nominee, Sonia Sotomayor, not because I agreed with her, but because she was qualified. Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia was confirmed unanimously. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, likely the most liberal current justice, was confirmed 96-3. … From my August op-ed: The current rudeness in the Senate is a recent phenomenon. Historically, senators have recognized that bipartisan approval of qualified nominees helps to increase the Supreme Court’s esteem, confirm its impartiality, and strengthen it as an institution. Some Democrat senators already have announced their opposition to Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Why have a hearing and why demand to review more of his writings if you’ve already decided how to vote? … His devotion to that cause is hardly his most newsworthy accomplishment. But it underlaid many of his most important decisions. We have seen nearly a week of eulogies. There is little left to add. But there is one aspect that I would like to emphasize. And that was John McCain’s respect for the United States Senate as an institution.pic.twitter.com/rqBolX81O4 One of the reasons Tennessee has been able to have so much success building cars and SUV’s is because the North American Free Trade Agreement is fundamentally a zero tariff treaty. Now, 136,000 Tennesseans – one third of our state’s manufacturing jobs – work in the automotive industry at plants and suppliers in 88 of our 95 counties. Tennessee’s automotive industry is so important to me because in 1978, when I was running for governor, Tennessee did not have hardly any auto jobs.

It is important to protect the integrity of research funded by the federal government. It is also important to recognize the role that scientists from other countries have played in research funded by the U.S. government. .@NIHDirector Dr. Francis Collins recently told Senator @PattyMurray and me information about an ongoing investigation into federally funded research, including, in some cases, research conducted by foreign nationals. This spending is part of the so-called discretionary spending, which is roughly 29 percent of all federal spending and includes NIH, national defense, national parks, and national laboratories. So, funding for research is not the reason for the increasing federal debt. The second thing to keep in mind is that these large increases in funding for biomedical research and other increases for our national laboratories and other basic research are not the part of the federal budget that creates the huge national deficit. There are two things I think we should keep in mind when we look at the large increases in funding Congress has given the @NIH in recent years: First, we often say it is hard to think of a major scientific advancement since WWII that has not been supported by federal funding. Development of a new, non-addictive painkiller, which may be the “holy grail” to solving the opioid crisis; and, The creation of a safe and effective artificial pancreas, making life easier and healthier for the millions of Americans with diabetes. Some of those predictions were: Being able to identify Alzheimer’s disease before symptoms appear; The possibility we could rebuild a patient’s heart with their own cells; Development of new vaccines, including for Zika and HIV/AIDS, and a universal flu vaccine… The reason Congress has devoted so much funding to biomedical research is captured in testimony you gave to the Senate Appropriations Committee in April 2016, when you offered ten “bold predictions” of what we might be able to achieve in the next ten years. The purpose of this hearing is oversight, to make sure that this record amount of billions of new dollars for biomedical research is being spent wisely. Today, we expect the full Senate to approve an additional $2 billion increase to @NIH funding for next year. If the bill we hope the Senate approves today is signed into law, Congress will have increased funding for NIH by $9 billion since 2015 – a 30% increase. In 2015 and 2016, Congress increased funding for NIH by $2 billion each year. And then in 2017, Congress increased funding for NIH by $3 billion, including $500 million to work on a non-addictive painkiller. So I said, In December, 2016, Congress passed what @SenateMajLdr called the “most important legislation of the year,” the 21st Century Cures Act. Not long ago, I ran into a friend who is very interested in Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s cancer research. He said, “Isn’t it a shame that the government isn’t funding biomedical research like it ought to.” HAPPENING NOW … I’m about to chair the Senate health committee’s oversight hearing on the @NIH with @NIHDirector Dr. Francis Collins.

Watch here:  … With @POTUS’ signature, more than 200,000 Tennesseans who participate in career and technical education programs will get a boost in learning the skills that help them find a good job and put them on the path towards the middle class. The #PerkinsCTE Act funds the programs that help train those skilled workers—for example, a high school student wanting to become a computer coder, or an adult going back to school to learn about commercial construction. At a time when our economy is booming, what I hear most often from Tennessee employers is that they need more skilled workers. Today, @POTUS signed #PerkinsCTE into law, which would not have passed without the leadership of @SenatorEnzi, @IvankaTrump, @SenBobCasey and @PattyMurray.  … I’m headed to the White House to join @IvankaTrump and @SenatorEnzi as @POTUS signs #PerkinsCTE into law. This legislation, which was passed by the committee I chair, will help Tennesseans learn the skills they need to find good jobs. As we look at how to reduce health care costs, we should keep in mind that what may seem like a good idea or a magic bullet in Washington may actually result in something very different for doctors and nurses. The Trump Administration has taken a look at what administrative tasks are required by the federal government and I am glad to see that @SeemaCMS & @CMSGov, which oversees Medicare & Medicaid, recently proposed streamlining many of the agency’s burdensome reporting requirements. The average community hospital needs 23 full time employees just to keep up with the regulations about what a hospital needs to do to participate in Medicare – called “Conditions of Participation,” according to the @ahahospitals. According to the @ahahospitals, there are 629 different regulatory requirements from four different federal agencies that doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers have to comply with. This is just one example of how well-intentioned ideas from Washington can turn out to add to the administrative burdens doctors face. Unfortunately, electronic health records systems have ended up being something physicians too often dread, rather than a tool that’s useful. For example, there was a lot of excitement over electronic health records in Washington – many said these records systems would make it easier for doctors and patients to access a patient’s health records and share information with other doctors. While many administrative tasks in the health care system come from outside the federal government—such as insurance company or state requirements—the federal government is clearly at fault for some of this burden. Administrative costs are much higher in the U.S. than in other countries. According to Dr. Ashish Jha, a witness at our first hearing, administrative costs accounted for 8% of all health care spending in the U.S., roughly that is $264B, compared to only 1%-3% for other countries. Today, we are examining the cost of administrative tasks – which includes everything from the time spent filling out insurance claims to buying software for an electronic health records system. At our last hearing, we focused on reducing what we spend on health care by examining two things: one, on reducing unnecessary health care tests, services, procedures, and prescription drugs, and two, how to increase preventive care.

Another type of apprenticeship is an “Industry Recognized Apprenticeship.” These apprenticeships are an alternative to federally-registered apprenticeships, with more flexible requirements developed by industry and less administrative red tape. One way for workers to learn new skills is what we are looking at today: apprenticeships. Today, federally-registered apprenticeships are especially concentrated in industries like construction and manufacturing, and work well for many employers and workers. On Monday, the Senate passed an update to the #PerkinsCTE – which this committee worked on – a nearly $1.2 billion federal program of grants to states that help fund CTE programs at high schools and community colleges. In this booming economy, there are 6.6 million job openings, and what I hear most from Tennessee employers is that they need more skilled workers. Congress is doing our part to close the skills gap. The United States is in the middle of the best economy in 18 years – and in one month this year, the unemployment rate fell as low as it has been since 1969, nearly half a century ago. For the millions of Americans who are looking for ways to improve their skills, make a good wage, and live the American Dream, high-quality apprenticeship programs- whether federally- registered or not- are a smart path forward. We are here today to explore ways to modernize apprenticeships, which are training programs that allow workers to “earn and learn” at the same time.

To make the menu labeling rule more workable for restaurants and to make access to nutrition information easier for customers, the House passed the bipartisan Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act twice, both times with strong bipartisan votes. When Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, they included a provision mandating nutrition labeling in restaurants and food retailers with over 20 stores nationwide. The final menu labeling rule went into effect earlier this year.  … Today Senate Democrats blocked a common-sense bill introduced by myself and @RoyBlunt to prevent a 21-year-old manager at a Tennessee Chick-fil-A from facing criminal and financial penalties if an employee puts extra slices of cheese on a sandwich.pic.twitter.com/9n2ZD1ztF1 Today at about 4:00 PM EDT, I’ll be speaking on the Senate floor alongside @RoyBlunt to discuss our bipartisan Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act.

The approval of these four bills will add to the already significant bipartisan legislative accomplishments this Committee has achieved so far this Congress. Fourth, we will consider the Action for Dental Health Act that @CoryBooker, along with @BillCassidy, @MazieHirono, and @SenatorTimScott have worked on, to help prevent dental disease, and expand efforts to provide care to low-income and underserved patients. This bill will allow the @HHSgov to study sickle cell disease and other heritable blood disorders so we know how many people are affected by these conditions and implement strategies to help treat these diseases. Third, we will consider @SenatorTimScott and @CoryBooker’s Sickle Cell Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention and Treatment Act. Second, we will consider the Congenital Heart Futures Act, introduced by @SenatorDurbin, which will continue to support research that will advance our understanding of congenital heart disease. In other words, if you walk into a pharmacy and ask for the prescription your doctor has written for an antibiotic, you might have a copay of $40 under your insurance plan but if you pay with cash, it could only be $5. First, we will consider @SenatorCollins’ Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, which would ban “gag clauses” that prevent a pharmacist from telling a patient a drug may be cheaper if they pay with cash instead of their insurance. Today we are going to consider four bills that will help millions of Americans – including those with sickle cell and congenital heart disease, those with limited access to dental care and people who are struggling to afford their prescriptions.

Today I joined @SenatorRisch, @Sen_JoeManchin & @SenatorHeitkamp in introducing the bipartisan Recovering America’s Wildlife Act. This legislation is based upon a sound conservation principle: take money created by an environmental burden and use it for an environmental benefit. Today in the Senate health committee, we heard the remarkable testimony that in the United States, we may be wasting as much as half of what we spend on health care, and the United States spends nearly 19 percent of all of our wealth on healthcare.pic.twitter.com/WmEkVOlta7 It’s great to have Dr. Jeff Balser, the Dean of @VUMChealth, testifying today at our health committee’s hearing to look at how to reduce health care costs. Today we are discussing how to eliminate unnecessary health care spending and improving quality and value for patients.pic.twitter.com/6RmLAlJcZj Ms. Martin did not have a confirmation hearing, nor did any of the assistant secretaries for this position going all the way back to the Clinton Administration. To compare, President Obama’s first Assistant Secretary for Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development, Carmel Martin was nominated on March 18, 2009, and was confirmed 44 days later by voice vote. At Democrats’ request, the HELP committee held a confirmation hearing for James Blew on November 15, 2017. The committee first approved his nomination on December 13, 2017, 216 days ago. Former DC public schools chancellor Michelle Rhee, a Democrat, called James Blew "an important partner and advisor to me since my days as Chancellor in D.C." when Blew replaced her as head of her organization StudentsFirst. For 20 years, he has advocated for improving educational opportunities for families and children by overseeing grants to low-income, high-risk schools. James Blew is well-qualified to lead the Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development and did not need to be subject to seven months of delays by Senate Democrats. At 11:45 AM, the Senate will vote on the nomination of James Blew to serve as Assistant Secretary for Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development at the Education Department. At this second hearing, I hope to learn from our witnesses specific recommendations on how to start investing more in preventive care and how to stop spending money on unnecessary medical tests, services, procedures, or medications. We need to find ways to improve care and maximize the quality of the health care patients do receive by looking at what medical tests, services, procedures, or medications are really necessary or if there are more cost effective alternatives. Unnecessary spending is a burden on the health care system and on the patients who undergo tests and procedures that may not be medically necessary – and who are then stuck with the bill. And second: The lack of preventive care, which results in spending money on health care services that could have been avoided if the patient had received care earlier. Today, we will discuss two of these categories of wasteful spending: First, unnecessary spending, which does not actually help patients get better or was spent on unnecessary medical tests, services, procedures, or medications. According to the @theNASEM in 2009 there was $750 billion in wasted health care spending, or as much as 30 percent of our total health care spending. Our focus today is on reducing wasted health care spending, which is important given the estimated amount we spend on unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs, fraud, and other problems is a great, big number. This is the second in a series of hearings to look at how to reduce health care costs, as they continue to increase for families, taxpayers, and employers.

The news that insurance companies in TN requested lower health insurance premiums on average for the 2019 plan year is a welcome step for our state after we’ve faced an over 176% increase in health insurance premiums since Obamacare took effect.

Unfortunately, the Senate has gotten into a bad habit of treating good people as “innocent until nominated.” Wishing George Bush a very happy birthday! #HBD43pic.twitter.com/1K3tMEmeGv Good news for Campbell County: @BMT_Global is investing $3.7 million to create 100 jobs at a new facility in Jellico and is expanding its Jacksboro plant, which will create another 48 jobs. The new Tennessee State Veterans Cemetery in Parkers Crossroads opens today, which will help ensure veterans and their families receive the honor and respect they deserve for their service and sacrifice. We especially honor the brave men and women who have fought and sacrificed for our freedom, and those who are currently fighting to keep us safe and free. It’s easy to turn on cable news or talk radio and hear about all the things that are wrong with our country, but today we remember the rich history of our nation and what a remarkable privilege it is to be an American. Nearly 250 years ago, the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence – a statement to the world that all men are created equal and endowed by our Creator with the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.pic.twitter.com/ch0lg27xh3 The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks will hold a hearing on July 11 to discuss our bipartisan legislation to eliminate $6.5 billion of the deferred maintenance backlog at our 417 national parks.

The end result is $6.5 billion toward eliminating the national park maintenance backlog, $215 million of which is in the @GreatSmokyNPS. I’ve joined @senrobportman, @MarkWarner, @SenAngusKing, @SenCoryGardner and @SenCapito in introducing the Restore Our Parks Act – legislation that could do more to restore our 417 national parks than anything that has happened in the last half century.  … Good news for Johnson City: The @ARCgov just awarded @CoJCTN $400,000 to invest in water infrastructure. #PerkinsCTE would make important, necessary updates to career and technical education to give workers and students the skills they need to find high-skill, high-wage and in-demand jobs.

Today, we heard about the importance of more competition as a way to bring down costs.pic.twitter.com/RoYsnRvO0T The Senate HELP committee approved the reauthorization of the PREEMIE Act, aimed at preventing premature births. It includes important updates to address the current opioid crisis, because expectant mothers taking opioids are at higher risk of delivering their babies prematurely.pic.twitter.com/GW05NM0chp Thank you for stopping by my office today. It was great meeting you, Leeya! … Most Tennesseans think two things about health care costs – one, they are too high, and two, they are indecipherable. We began a series of five hearings this morning in the Senate health committee, which I chair, to look for ways to reduce health care costs.pic.twitter.com/xZHDUmiQAm I hope President Trump will promptly nominate his successor, and I’m confident the Senate will move quickly to carefully consider that nominee. Anthony Kennedy has served on the United States Supreme Court with intelligence and with distinction as he has interpreted and defended the Constitution in a deliberate and responsible way.pic.twitter.com/dNfH7fjDhs About one out of every ten babies born in Tennessee is born early.

As chairman of the Senate's health committee, I've worked to help UT and other mobile stroke providers receive reimbursements from @CMSGov. … Today we will take the first step toward reducing health care costs by understanding the cost of health care – to taxpayers, employers, and individuals like Todd. So, Todd was surprised when he received a bill for $1800 – because even though the emergency room was “in-network,” the doctor who treated his son was not. That is what I heard from Todd, a Knoxville father, who recently took his son to an emergency room after a bicycle accident. His son was treated, Todd paid a $150 copay because the emergency room was “in-network” for his health insurance, and they headed home. The average American is shocked by the cost of their health care. They don’t understand what they are being charged for and why it costs so much, and they want better answers. The most obvious fact about health care costs, other than that they’re too high, is that they are indecipherable. Any one of us who has received a hospital bill in the mail or has tried to figure out their health insurance benefits has wondered what it all means. The first step to reducing health care costs is to better understand the cost of health care in America and understand why health care in America costs so much more than it does in other countries. Warren Buffett has called the ballooning costs of health care…“a hungry tapeworm on the American economy.” According to the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the @HHSGov, which is the health data office at HHS, we spent $2.2 trillion dollars on health care in 2006. This is projected to grow to $5.7 trillion in 2026 – that is a 159 percent increase. So today, we are beginning a series of hearings looking at how to reduce health care costs, including examining administrative costs, waste, how to improve transparency, private sector solutions, and other important issues as they come up. But, the hard truth is that we will never get the cost of health insurance down until we get the cost of health care down. For the last seven years, Republicans and Democrats have been locked in a debate over health insurance, primarily the individual insurance market, which is important but is where only six percent of insured Americans get their health insurance. HAPPENING NOW … I’m headed to chair our bipartisan Senate health committee hearing to better understand the cost of health care in America. It’s the first in a series of hearings to explore how to reduce health care costs.  Watch here:  …pic.twitter.com/mnvboCkoS9 It was great to have @IvankaTrump here today as the Senate HELP Committee advanced the #PerkinsCTE Act. Thank you, Ivanka, for your leadership in updating this important law for students and adult workers.pic.twitter.com/octdixAgLk I am glad to see we are moving forward in a bipartisan way on important bills and nominees. This committee has reached significant legislative accomplishments so far this year, and we still have six months to go. This bipartisan reauthorization by @SenatorEnzi and @SenBobCasey limits the role of the Secretary of Education and allows states to make changes that are best for their students and more closely align to the CTE programs with our workforce system and needs. In Tennessee, over 200,000 students participate in CTE programs, with the most popular programs preparing students for careers in health care, business administration and agriculture. #PerkinsCTE Companies in Tennessee, and across the U.S., are in the market for not just workers, but especially for skilled workers. #PerkinsCTE is a nearly $1.2 billion federal program of grants to states that help fund programs that train the workers we need. The committee will also vote on the bipartisan reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. #PerkinsCTE This reauthorization, led by @SenBennet and myself, includes important updates to address the opioid crisis, because expectant mothers taking opioids are at higher risk of delivering their babies prematurely. The PREEMIE Act was first signed into law by President Bush in 2006 and reauthorized in 2013. This law has helped give more babies the chance for long and healthy lives. It is important we pass this bill today so the full Senate can consider it before many of the programs expire. We are also voting on Scott Stump as Assistant Secretary for Career, Technical, and Adult Education at the @usedgov and John Lowry III to serve as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans’ Employment and Training at the @USDOL. Today we are considering the PREEMIE Act, sponsored by @SenBennet and myself, followed by three additional bills: Maternal Health Accountability Act, Sports Licensure Medical Clarity Act and the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. HAPPENING NOW … I’m headed to chair the Senate HELP Committee’s markup of the PREEMIE Act, Maternal Health Accountability Act, Sports Licensure Medical Clarity Act and the #PerkinsCTE Act.

But last week and tonight we have taken an appropriations process, which has been incomplete and broken for the last several years, and we have done what we are supposed to do. Senators shouldn't get an award for restoring the appropriations process any more than Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts should get a merit badge for telling the truth, because that's what we are supposed to do.  … Today, the Senate confirmed Frank Brogan to serve as @usedgov’s Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education. I look forward to working with him as he oversees our education law that restores more freedom of decision-making to states and local schools. Today’s bill includes the fourth year of record funding for our 17 national laboratories and third year of increased funding for biomedical research.  … Today, the Senate passed the first appropriations bills for the next fiscal year, including the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill from the subcommittee I chair. … HAPPENING NOW … I’ll be speaking on the Senate floor at approximately 4:50 PM EDT in support of the final passage of the Energy and Water Development funding bill that came out of the subcommittee I chair. You can watch here:   This is one more example of how federal government sponsored research has been a crucial part of making it possible for the U.S. to produce 24% of the world’s wealth for just 5% of the world’s people. @POTUS should include supercomputing as part of his ‘America First’ agenda. Scientists around the world have been working to develop faster supercomputers, and @ORNL just built the fastest one.

Association health plans would be required to comply with the same patient protections as plans at larger companies, including prohibitions against charging more or denying coverage because of a preexisting condition. The rule will allow small businesses of similar trades or geographies to join together and offer insurance to their employees. For example, bakeries and small sporting-goods stores in Chattanooga, Tenn., could come together and purchase a plan for their employees. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta and the Trump administration have come up with a potential solution within existing law. Today, if you’re a self-employed plumber or a farmer or a waitress at a small restaurant, you likely don’t have access to the same kind of lower-cost health insurance, tax breaks and patient protections that employees of bigger companies, such as IBM or Microsoft, enjoy. READ: My op-ed in the Washington Post on a new rule from @POTUS and @SecretaryAcosta that will help self-employed Americans and more small businesses to band together to buy health insurance coverage through Association Health Plans. … This new rule could help the self-employed and employees of small businesses get access to lower cost employer insurance  — both groups have been particularly hurt by Obamacare. #AHPs New #AHPs initiative could allow a self-employed Tennessee plumber or farmer or employee of a small business to buy lower cost employer health insurance that includes the same protections, such as coverage for pre-existing conditions, that employees of large companies have. New Trump Administration #AHPs rule would give potentially millions more Americans access to lower-cost employer insurance.  … My statement on the separation of children from their parents at the border:pic.twitter.com/eUnaRQG31i Right now, @HRSAgov has clear authority to determine if hospitals, clinics, and drug companies are eligible to participate in the 340B Program. However, it is unclear if it has the statutory authority to oversee other aspects of the program. Congress needs more accurate information to determine how to make the 340B Program work better for patients and hospitals.  … I look forward to hearing from our witness with @HRSAgov today, and our other committee members about what Congress can do to evaluate the 340B Program, measure the program’s performance, and ensure that the agency responsible for the program is conducting proper oversight. Data is necessary to demonstrate the value of the 340B Program, and Congress cannot evaluate the program, conduct oversight, or consider changes to improve the program without more information. We learned at our two previous hearings on the program, there is no consistent data that shows how hospitals and clinics are spending the money they save through the 340B Program. Some of the time, the 340B discount is passed directly to the patient as a lower priced drug. Other times, the hospital or clinic uses the savings to provide other services to patients like the programs Methodist, Saint Thomas, and Erlanger run. They are all able to provide these services because of the money they save by participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which requires drug manufacturers that participate in Medicaid to provide discounts on prescriptions drugs to qualifying hospitals and clinics. And, Erlanger Health System in Chattanooga delivers prescription drugs at no cost to low-income patients at their homes, to ensure they are receiving and taking their medications. Saint Thomas Health in Nashville operates four Dispensary of Hope pharmacy sites across the state of Tennessee, providing low-income, uninsured patients with free or low-cost prescription drugs. .@SenAlexander: At Methodist Hospital in downtown Memphis, five employees working as “community navigators” go to events in Memphis to give local residents preventative cancer tests and refer them to the Methodist cancer treatment center if necessary.

Watch here:  … These are a few of the proposals in the blueprint I am excited about, and I look forward to hearing from @SecAzar about others. The blueprint also proposes ending the so-called ‘gag-rule’ that prevents a pharmacist from telling a patient a drug would be cheaper if they paid out of pocket instead of with their insurance. Another action @US_FDA is considering is requiring drug manufacturers to include the list price of a drug in television commercials or other advertising materials. In President Trump’s blueprint, there are some steps the Administration has started to take or are intending to take. For example, @US_FDA is going to start going after bad actors gaming the system to delay generics from going to market. According to the  @KaiserFamFound, about half of Americans – that’s about 163 million people – take a prescription drug. And about one in eight Americans say it is difficult to afford those prescriptions. In May, President Trump announced a comprehensive blueprint to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. Today we are pleased to hear from @SecAzar to help us understand that blueprint and what the Administration plans to do to implement it and what legislation might be necessary. Today we are holding our fourth bipartisan hearing this Congress on drug pricing and we will hear from @HHSGov @SecAzar on @POTUS’s blueprint to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.

Insurance premiums are rising again because of a law that Democrats enacted, voted not to repeal and replace, and refuse to fix. Democrats voted for the Hyde compromise more than 100 times in the Omnibus spending bill to which Republicans wanted to attach the 40 percent reduction in rates. In March, Democrats used the excuse of not wanting to vote for the traditional Hyde compromise on regulating federal abortion spending that Democrats have voted for every year since 1976. What I do not know how to do is to deal with Democrats who are unwilling to change a sentence in their Obamacare law even while a self-employed contractor making $60,000 might be paying $15,000 or $20,000 for health insurance. I know how to be bipartisan and how to get results. As chairman of the Senate’s health and education committee, I have worked with Democrats to solve big differences. We fixed No Child Left Behind, enacted 21st Century Cures, and unanimously approved legislation to combat the opioids epidemic. In March, Democrats blocked a proposal that President Trump and Republicans offered to enact that experts at Oliver Wyman health consulting firm said would lower premiums by up to 40 percent over three years. Rates in Tennessee have risen over 176 percent since every Democrat (and no Republican) voted for Obamacare in 2010. Last year, every Democrat voted against repealing and replacing Obamacare which would have given Americans more choices of insurance at lower cost. Health insurance premiums are skyrocketing again and Democrats are scrambling to blame the increases on someone else. They should look in the mirror. Today, @SecretaryPerry and @ENERGY announced that @ORNL has built the world’s most powerful supercomputer.

Congratulations to Nashville’s leadership and @BillHaslam for bringing the draft to @visitmusiccity. I first introduced this bipartisan legislation with @RandPaul in 2013 to prevent the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from restricting fishing below 10 dams along the Cumberland River. … The Republican Congress is working to extend the Freedom to Fish Act for 5 more years because we don’t need Big Brother holding the hands of fishermen in Tennessee and Kentucky who have the right to fish below publicly owned dams on the Cumberland River.  … From the @Tennessean: “Fentanyl killed more people than heroin in Davidson County for the first time ever last year, signaling that the core of the local opioid crisis has shifted to a new tier of powerful and dangerous drugs.”   … … The opioid crisis is ravaging communities in Tennessee – and across the country – and that’s why I’m working on bipartisan legislation to take the next step in helping states like Tennessee fight the opioid crisis. #HELPFightsOpioidspic.twitter.com/d7lRk3ec95 I want to thank @SenatorBurr, @SenBobCasey, @PattyMurray and all of their staff members for their hard work to ensure we are prepared for and able to respond to the next public health emergency. It is important to reauthorize this legislation before it expires in September. My hope is we can approve the bill today so the whole Senate can quickly consider it. .@SenatorBurr, who authored the original legislation in 2006 and led the first reauthorization effort in 2013, along with @SenBobCasey, have again worked hard on this bipartisan reauthorization. .@SenAlexander: The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act authorizes programs that protect Americans from 21st century threats, including natural disasters, bioterror attacks, or infectious disease outbreaks, like a pandemic flu or Ebola. HAPPENING NOW … Tune in today at 10:00 AM EDT for the HELP Committee’s hearing to markup the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act. Watch here:  … Today the House passed the #RightToTry legislation, which had bipartisan support in the HELP committee. The legislation that is headed to @POTUS’s desk will allow seriously ill patients to request access to experimental medicines that have yet to be approved by the @US_FDA. … Today the Senate health committee, which I chair, held a bipartisan hearing to learn how the federal government can help reduce shortages of health care professionals in rural areas.  …pic.twitter.com/rjQM9winj0 I would tell @POTUS and @OMBPress that science, research and innovation is what made America first, and I recommend that the president add science, research and innovation to his “America First” agenda. This appropriations bill is a good first step toward doing that. The bill also provides $6.927 billion for the @USACEHQ to maintain and rebuild our nation’s waterways, including up to $99.5 million to fully fund construction at Chickamauga Lock for the fifth consecutive year.  … This funding bill will also modernize our nuclear weapons facilities at @y12nsc and accelerate cleanup of the East Tennessee Technology Park, @ORNL and the Y-12 National Security Complex.  … Today, the Senate Appropriations subcommittee I chair approved legislation that provides the 4th year of record funding for @ENERGY's 17 national laboratories, including @ORNL.  … … Today the House passed the Childhood Cancer STAR Act, a bill that had bipartisan support in the @GOPHELP Committee and supports pediatric cancer research including at @StJude. Today I chaired a bipartisan Senate health committee hearing focused on this problem: as our population grows older, the gap between the number of us who need health care and the number who are there to provide health care gets bigger and bigger.pic.twitter.com/GfbRUDjPHY HAPPENING NOW … Listen in today at 2:30 PM EDT as I chair the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee markup of the fiscal year 2019 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill:  … Today, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approved John Ryder to serve on the @TVAnews Board of Directors. John is the right person to help keep TVA on a good path, and I hope he will be quickly considered and confirmed by the Senate.  … We need to know if what the federal government currently is doing is effective or if specific improvements should be made. Do we need all of these programs, or should there be changes to better meet the needs of patients? And finally, we spend about $310 million for the National Health Service Corps, which provides loan repayment for primary care doctors who go to work in under-served areas.  Most of these doctors choose to work at the 10,000 community health centers across the country. Second, we spend over $1B on about 70 different health workforce programs that provide scholarships and loan repayment for students, faculty, and health care professionals in exchange for working in rural areas. All of these programs are within the HELP committee’s jurisdiction. First, about $10 billion goes to Medicare Graduate Medical Education Programs, which funds resident training for new doctors. That program is in the jurisdiction of the Finance committee The federal government is currently doing three things to help reduce and prevent shortages of health care workers. The shortage affects certain populations more than others. In 2014, the @acognews reported that 47 rural Tennessee counties, out of 95 total, had no OB-GYN. That means a couple may have to travel to Memphis, Nashville or Knoxville to see an OB-GYN. According to the @ruralhealth, there are only 39 primary care doctors for every 100,000 people living in rural areas, but there are 53 primary care doctors for every 100,000 people in urban areas. We know that the shortage of health care professionals – which includes doctors, nurses, paramedics, and x-ray technicians – is a problem that has the potential to keep getting worse. Today’s bipartisan hearing is an opportunity to learn about the growing shortage of health care professionals – especially in rural areas – and better understand where health care professionals are choosing to work so we can start addressing shortages across the country. HAPPENING NOW … Tune in at 10:00 AM EDT for the HELP Committee’s hearing on how the federal government can help reduce shortages of health care professionals in rural areas. Watch here:  … I will continue to tell the president that NAFTA has been good for Tennessee, and I look forward to working with Ambassador Lighthizer to help make sure that changes to NAFTA do not hurt workers or consumers. Changes to NAFTA could make it more expensive to build cars in Tennessee, threatening thousands of jobs in 88 counties, and make it harder for businesses and farmers to export their products. Today I along w/ 31 Republican senators sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer urging him not to give Congress an ultimatum on changing NAFTA that could jeopardize American jobs and economic growth:  … Lamar Alexander: Democrats refuse to be at the table | Opinion  WATCH @WCTE’s “One on One” with @beckymagura here —> … Tune in to @WCTE tonight at 7:30 PM EDT for my conversation with @beckymagura about what I am working on in Washington for Tennesseans. .@CNN got this right: Memphis is the best place in the world to visit in May!  … Hope everyone is enjoying the @memphisinmay festivities.

It is my hope that children across the country will take some time to celebrate #KidstoParks Day and create their own memories. Happy #KidstoParks Day! In this age of smartphones and tablets, our national parks are even more, not less, important. Children are able to escape their digital diet to feast on a world of natural splendor and learn history in a place where history comes alive. Congratulations to the Tennessee Valley Authority as it celebrates 85 years of service. @TVANew’s continued success is vital to our state’s families and businesses -- it employs more than 6,500 Tennesseans and has helped create nearly 45,000 jobs in Tennessee in the last year. … Stay up-to-date with what I’m working on for Tennesseans by signing up for my weekly newsletter HERE →  … My statement on the Senate’s confirmation of Gina Haspel to serve as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency:  …pic.twitter.com/zXj9lwsU1L I look forward to working with Deputy Secretary Zais to implement our new law fixing No Child Left Behind and making it simpler and less expensive for students to attend college. … Zais has broad experience in public education. He has been a college president, state superintendent of education, and a Brigadier General. The nation is fortunate that someone of this caliber will serve as Deputy Secretary of Education.  … … Senate Democrats’ five month delay in confirming Brigadier General Mitchell Zais as Deputy Secretary of Education was inexcusable. This extremely well-qualified nominee did not deserve to be subject to Democrats’ unreasonable and unnecessary obstruction.  … Great meeting you all. Enjoy your trip to Washington! … Since @POTUS took office last January, the Republican Senate majority has confirmed 21 U.S. Circuit Court judges – President H.W. Bush was the last president to have that many U.S. Circuit Court nominees confirmed by their second year in office. The judges confirmed include nominees who have clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, are currently serving as District Court judges and have been confirmed by the Senate before. The Senate voted to confirm six Federal appeals judges this month, including John B. Nalbandian to the Sixth Circuit, which includes Tennessee.  … This week, we welcome thousands of police officers from Tennessee and across the country to the nation’s capital for #PoliceWeek. I am proud to be a cosponsor of @ChuckGrassley’s bipartisan resolution that recognizes law enforcement officers’ vital role. One of the most important things we do as United States senators is oversight of programs to see if taxpayer money is being spent the way it's supposed to. And today, our health committee finished an oversight hearing on the 340B Discount Drug Program.pic.twitter.com/vDlO9Qt1ba Today, we honor the police officers in Tennessee and across the country who have fallen in the line of duty. #PeaceOfficersMemorialDay .@USATODAY: “Songwriters, music executives urge Congress to pass first music copyright reform in decades” #StandWithSongwriters … Today, I chaired an oversight hearing in the Senate health committee on the 340B Discount Drug Program, which requires pharmaceutical companies to give hospitals and clinics steep discounts on the price of drugs so they can provide more care for low income Tennesseans.pic.twitter.com/jU1dNnAYAY It was great to have @ImEddieMoney in my office yesterday.

Now efforts to help Americans paying skyrocketing premiums will turn to the Trump Administration and the states.  … Democrats are already busy finding someone to blame after they blocked a proposal that could have helped avoid a sixth straight year of insurance rate increases since Obamacare took effect. …
