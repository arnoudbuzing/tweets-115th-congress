We are so thankful for our @INGuardsman and their families. … Jenny and I would like to wish all Hoosiers a very #MerryChristmas and a happy New Year.  In support of Fort Wayne’s 122nd Air National Guard Fighter Wing, @SenDonnelly and I sent a letter to the leaders of the Senate & House Appropriations Committees asking for full funding for new A-10 wing sets. Read the letter here:  It’s official, @POTUS has signed our #taxreform bill into law – providing tax relief to Hoosiers for many years to come. Glad we are working together to ensure Hoosier students are competitive in the 21st century economy. … Hoosier farmers should be afforded the flexibility to plant crops that work for them. I look forward to ensuring that our agriculture community has the proper tools to remain a leader in feeding the world: … Here’s my statement on Saudi Arabia’s announcement related to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen: … Introduced a bill to reauthorize Title VI of the Higher Education Act to ensure that our students can remain competitive through investment in international and foreign language education. … Today, our resolution to designate August 3rd, 2018 as National Ernie Pyle Day was agreed to in the Senate. Learn more about our efforts to commemorate this important Hoosier: … For the first time in 30 years, #TaxReform has passed the House and Senate awaiting the President’s signature. Now, Hoosiers are close to a simpler and fairer tax code that allows them to keep more of their hard-earned money. We just passed the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct, historic #taxreform legislation that benefits middle-class Hoosier families and small businesses. Watch and learn more --> … On my way to the @SenateFloor to talk #TaxReform. Now is the time to provide needed tax relief to Hoosier families.

Soon I’ll cast my vote for a simpler & fairer tax code that allows Hoosiers to keep more of their hard-earned money. Need help with a federal agency? Members of my staff will be holding mobile office hours in Franklin County tomorrow at 10am and 2:30pm:pic.twitter.com/dctwPIewEb Just spoke with @SenToddYoung ahead of today's expected  #TaxReform vote- Young supports the latest version of the bill and says "it will result in a fairer tax code and allow rank & file Hoosiers to keep more of what they earn" - see more tonight & Sunday #INfocus @FOX59 “…Saudi Arabia’s impediments to humanitarian assistance in Yemen violate international law, humanitarian principles, and U.S. law, and are inconsistent with U.S. national security interests.” … As I wrote @POTUS last week, “The Saudis have a right to defend themselves, but they have no right... to deliberately starve millions of people. Suggesting we must choose between defeating Iran’s efforts in Yemen and permitting unimpeded humanitarian access is a false choice…” Consistent with my repeated calls since March & letter to @POTUS last week, I applaud @StateDept Deputy Sec. for demanding the Saudis permit full humanitarian/commercial access to Yemen & the delivery of the U.S.-funded @WFP cranes … Need help with a federal agency? Members of my staff will be holding mobile office hours in Jackson County tomorrow at 2pm:pic.twitter.com/ZSzvjATnX2 Here’s my statement from last week on the Yemen humanitarian crisis:  Powerful reporting on Yemen humanitarian crisis by @clarissaward.

Hoping to help welcome home more new Hoosiers very soon!pic.twitter.com/muE8oJtXZU Today, I led a letter of support for the nomination of @LifeAtPurdue’s Executive VP to the National Science Board. Dr Garimella’s leadership at Purdue is marked by a commitment to scientific research & demonstrates his unique qualifications for the NSB:   Today we remember the brave Americans who gave their lives at #PearlHarbor. We remain forever grateful for their sacrifices. #PearlHarbor76 Bread for the World today applauds President Donald J.

Introduced fellow Hoosier, Alex Azar, in this morning’s @GOPHELP hearing on the @HHSGov nominee. He is an extremely qualified nominee & an outstanding choice to lead this critical agency.  Hard-working Hoosiers want a tax code that is simpler, fairer, and allows them to keep more of their money. Now is the time to take action that will provide relief, boost our economy, and help our small businesses grow.pic.twitter.com/7TsGW3QdBP Encouraged the House passed the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act that I introduced with @SenDonnelly.

That needs to stop." – @SenToddYoung #SmallBusinessSaturdaypic.twitter.com/31d1eK2xAX As someone who grew up in a small biz family, I know that small businesses are the lifeblood of Indiana’s economy. #TaxReform #SmallBizSatpic.twitter.com/vy5eEFToIi As we give thanks today, I wish all Hoosiers a happy & safe Thanksgiving with your loved ones.pic.twitter.com/Tr50iJJGbt That's a big reason why I led a bipartisan letter to UN Ambassador @nikkihaley & helped intro a bill that would impose targeted sanctions & travel restrictions on senior Burmese military officials. More here: … This is an important first step toward holding the perpetrators accountable. I will continue to do all I can to be responsive to my many constituents & fellow Hoosiers with friends and family in Burma. I applaud the administration's decision to call the Burmese military's atrocities against the Rohingya what they are: ethnic cleansing. … I’m proud to announce U.S. service academy nominations for 43 exemplary high school senior candidates from across Indiana. These young men and women should be commended for their hard work  If the Saudis fail to take these steps, bipartisan outrage will grow & I will work with the Trump administration & Congress to take appropriate action. That includes opening all Red Sea ports, ending travel restrictions on journalists & permitting U.S.-funded cranes to the port of Hodeidah. I renew my call on Riyadh to immediately and fully end all impediments to the delivery of humanitarian aid in Yemen. Tonight's @60Minutes shed light on Yemen's humanitarian crisis. Each day Saudi Arabia's blockade continues millions of innocent people suffer. … Beasley told #60Minutes that the World Food Programme’s ships are being blocked by Saudi Arabia, and asks that all parties engaged in this conflict respect humanitarian law. Tonight’s episode of @60Minutes will shed light on the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, which I have been very outspoken on: … Joined @GovHolcomb & @SenDonnelly on the field for the national anthem.

If he does not step aside, we need to act to protect the integrity of the Senate (2/2) After giving Roy Moore ample time to unequivocally deny the disturbing allegations against him, those allegations remain far more persuasive than the denials. Roy Moore should immediately drop out of the race. (1/2) As a member of the @AmericanLegion, I was honored to join last week’s ceremony for the American Legion Commemorative Coin Act becoming law. I was proud to introduce the Senate version of this bill.pic.twitter.com/VCjj1NMg51 Fellow Hoosier Alex Azar is an excellent choice to lead @HHSGov.
