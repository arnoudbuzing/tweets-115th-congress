CC: @SBAgov … Watch this morning's hearing LIVE here:  … … Congrats @realDonaldTrump on securing the release of three US detainees from North Korea. Well done. We’ve redone the way that firefighting is going to be funded, to free up the agency’s money to be used for what it should be used for. This was a bipartisan team effort and  I’m glad to have worked on this with my colleagues for so many years. #firefixedpic.twitter.com/LNpsC9eXsP Join SAF in thanking @CongMikeSimpson @MikeCrapo @SenatorRisch @RonWyden & many more for their years of leadership & commitment to passing legislation to address #wildfire funding. RT to say thank you for the #FireFix! … My full statement supporting @POTUS' announcement on the #IranDeal: … (5) Withdrawing from this deal creates an opportunity to move forward and pursue a solution to provide true security to the United States, our allies, the Middle East and the world. Iran knows what must be done. Until then, they will have to deal with the reality of sanctions. (4) reducing American security, threatening the survival of Israel, and allowing state-sponsored terror to flourish in the region. (3) The Iran Deal violated every red line that was drawn, from complete access to Iran's facilities and scientists to a robust inspection and verification regime. It also provided Iran with billions of dollars it has used to fuel terrorism and instability... (2) I believe that action will result in a safer world and a safer America. From the start, President Obama and Secretary Kerry told Congress there would be clear red lines for any deal with Iran. (1) Instead of stopping Iran’s nuclear program, the #IranDeal simply gave the regime a direct path to obtaining a nuclear weapon but at a slower pace. That was not acceptable. I support @POTUS' decision to withdraw from the #IranDeal.
