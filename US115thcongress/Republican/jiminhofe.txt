We've known the Bush family for a long time dating back to their time in the Texas oil industry, and she was always known as the most lovable mother. Like I said in December, tax cuts are getting America’s economic engine moving again—it’s working.  After #TaxDay, taxes are expected to decline across all income groups. 82 percent of middle-income taxpayers are expected to receive an income tax cut. Always a pleasure to talk with you, @okfarmbureau! … On this #TaxDay, between historic tax cuts and deregulation, we are laying a solid foundation for continued economic growth.

He’s serious about restoring US ability to build critical infrastructure on budget & on time. We need to cut red tape to ensure needed projects can get off the ground.  The private sector is ready and eager to invest in many of these critical projects but has been hesitant to jump because our flawed permitting process means their investment may take years   and years to get off the ground. I know this better than anyone.  America has always been a land of great builders — from Grand Lake in northeast Oklahoma to the Golden Gate Bridge and the inland waterway system, we’ve seen the dramatic economic impact that comes from investing in infrastructure. My op-ed in @WashTimes:  We owe it to the men and women who defend America to ensure we give them the funding they need to complete their mission.

There is no one-size-fits-all federal solution for #infrastructure. Local communities know best what they need.  The time is right to close the #infrastructure gap. The American economy is strong and poised to continue growing if Congress can work together to make smart decisions. The path to success is to start with shared goals.  .@SenWhitehouse & I serve on the Senate EPW Cmte, which has jurisdiction over most #infrastructure bills. Despite our differences, the cmte has produced some of the largest &most effective bipartisan legislation of the past decade. We need to do it again.  During his #SOTU, @POTUS called for a broad bipartisan #infrastructure package. If you believe the news reports on partisan bickering in DC, a bipartisan approach might seem impossible. But @SenWhitehouse and I know it can, and will, happen. Read our oped:  Rev. Graham brought men & women from all backgrounds to the Bible. We have lost a giant today, but I'm confident his work will continue through those he brought to Christ.

Our troops are counting on us. I urge my colleagues to pass this deal. @POTUS joined Congress in rightly prioritizing our military & his NDS recognizes the severe threats we face. Russia, China, North Korea, Iran & Islamic terrorism are stacking up against us. We need to provide significant new resources to our military to address these threats. This deal is necessary b/c it provides funding our military desperately needs. Our armed forces are facing the greatest threats in history & after chronic underfunding by Obama, our readiness & modernization efforts have fallen significantly behind both our adversaries and allies … Tax reform is working.

Good to hear @POTUS talk about streamlining decisions with infrastructure projects during his #SOTU – a long-time priority of mine.

Trump’s “America First” agenda is perfect for a new chapter in Africa; he and President Kagame can do it together. My Op-ed in @USATODAY --> … African nations want this too. Just look at Rwanda. Less than 20 years ago, Rwanda’s economy was nearly 70% foreign aid. Now, it’s down to a third. I was there in October and their progress is clear — the economy is booming. --> … President Trump’s “America First” agenda has reshaped our country in a bold, great way. It’s working. He needs to bring his “America First” approach to Africa. My Op-ed --> … Pleased the Senate confirmed R.D. James to be the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works today. I look forward to working with you on important infrastructure issues in Oklahoma. … This morning catch @JimInhofe on @kwhwradio, @955TheCoyote and K101 in Woodward talking about #TaxReform, success of @realDonaldTrump's first year and the importance of fully funding our military.pic.twitter.com/BLs9JbMz0b Thank you Minister Sinjari for taking time to update us about the current situation in Iraq as well as the KRG’s continued counterterrorism efforts.  …pic.twitter.com/W3dEDvDqDS We are a great team when we do that. … OPINION: Senator @JimInhofe: The Democrats' shutdown hurts our military  And the priorities we are supposed to be working on here are defending America. … I'm going to keep working towards reopening our government and passing a long term spending bill, but right now, only one thing is clear--it is the American people who will suffer if Sen. Schumer continues his politically motivated shutdown. While I am frustrated that Congress was unable to negotiate a long-term spending deal, I recognize that the only thing worse for our military than a CR is no funding at all. This Democrat shutdown will have serious ramifications for our military-negative impacts we can't afford. Tonight, Senate Democrats overwhelmingly voted against funding for our troops, veterans, seniors and CHIP over illegal immigration. The #NationalDefenseStrategy that #SecDef Mattis announced today is a forward thinking approach to reestablish the United States’ position as the undisputed leader of the free world. My take:  … You can watch the livestream of @POTUS's  #MarchforLife address here: … As the president prepares to address the @March_for_Life shortly, I want to thank @crossoveronline for allowing me on their show yesterday to talk about the importance of the #ProLife movement. #WhyWeMarchpic.twitter.com/2ZOkbXQrdt "Trump to Let Health Practitioners Skip Procedures on Religious Grounds" in @WSJPolitics  The pro-life movement is strong, especially with continued support from President Trump’s administration. … I sent a letter to the @EPA today supporting @EPAScottPruitt's effort to repeal the Clean Power Plan—a burdensome Obama-era rule that overstepped EPA authority & would have placed costly regulatory burdens on states. It's time to get rid of it. My letter:   Everyday, but especially today, we honor Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his profound contributions to our nation. #MLKDay … I have long identified the lack of inspections for undeclared sites, Iran’s ability to develop nuclear technology & sunset provisions as critical flaws of the deal, and I appreciate @realDonaldTrump's commitment to addressing these concerns. My statement:  … Grateful to join #KNIDagrifest to help kick off the event & talk about a new bill @SenatorTomUdall and I intro'd to improve fed wildfire disaster response, specifically for the ag community.

I identified three key reforms I wanted to address. Today, with @realDonaldTrump's signature, we have enacted those reforms into law.pic.twitter.com/ZuOf5dYbN7 When this tax cut is combined with @realDonaldTrump's deregulatory agenda, we’ll see businesses expand to new heights, reinvest in the future and create millions of jobs right again here in Oklahoma — not overseas. It’s about time.  In case you’ve heard in the media that this bill won’t help you, let’s walk through how this bill will actually cut taxes for an Oklahoma family of four making $65,000 per year.  We're on the cusp of something historic.  Shot: "I do remember the Reagan tax cuts” Chaser: “This is a Reagan tax cut.”   Sen. @JimInhofepic.twitter.com/rhBTqpJ1hD .@JimInhofe on @koconews: "The average family of four in Oklahoma will increase their take-home pay by just over $2,000 a year." #TaxCutAndJobsActpic.twitter.com/8GxjwS6UVf pic.twitter.com/OyeUQZEVWl It feels just like yesterday.

These are the powerful images to remember:  … My statement on the unspeakable violence in Dallas last night:  … I cosponsored and today voted for the Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act by @SenToomey & Kate’s Law by @SenTedCruz.   The murder of Kate Steinle by a 5-times deported illegal immigrant w/ 7 felony convictions shone a light on the dangers of sanctuary cities. Across the country, over 300 cities, counties and states are considered to have sanctuary policies creating safe havens illegal immigrants. Our immigration system is broken largely because of those who wish to eliminate and ignore our immigration laws altogether. To not hold Hillary accountable will further erode the public’s trust in our legal system... … While the FBI called Hillary's server as “gross negligence” in its report, I say that this is obvious intentional mishandling. FBI confirmed Clinton intentionally set up an unauthorized server & then proceeded to ignore warnings that her system was vulnerable. Sec. Hillary Clinton compromised our national security and has refused to be honest about her actions.  … "Freedom is never more than 1 gen. away from extinction.” My thoughts on Reagan’s words>>   …pic.twitter.com/1saMqMpscL This Independence Day, may we pause in reflection and gratitude for the freedoms we have come to enjoy in America.   … I will be asking SASC Chairman @SenJohnMcCain & RM @SenJackReed to hold hearings on OAdm transgender policy ancmt  … but instead the OAdm cont. to be more interested in forcing social agenda through the DOD instead of funding our military (2/2).

We have to exert American leadership again.
