The Families Act addresses this specific problem by overriding the court decision that has produced the current lose-lose situation and by providing the resources to expeditiously adjudicate asylum claims. They can either enforce the law, which practically requires children to be separated from parents, or they must revert to a policy of ‘catch and release.’ In dealing with families illegally crossing the border, our broken #immigration system leaves law enforcement with only two options — both of them bad.
