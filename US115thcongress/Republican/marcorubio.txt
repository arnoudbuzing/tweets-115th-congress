Today we passed the #NicaAct out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Very strong bipartisan support for punishing those responsible for the #Ortega regimes abuses in #Nicaragua. Will ask fed govt to oppose #KendallExpressway unless it: 1. Demonstrates consistency & avoids conflict with #EvergladesRestoration; & 2. Requires @MDXway to buy land east of Krome & make them available for #Everglades project in exchange for state & fed land no longer needed Well allow me to explain it to you. NBA has a global talent pool, including Lithuania. MLB has a global talent pool,including Japan. However overwhelming % of NFL players are U.S. born. If American parents stop letting their kids play,the sport dies. … Have known @MaElviraSalazar for close to 2 decades. She is a great journalist. But she would be a phenomenal member of Congress & effective common sense advocate for #Florida’s 27th Congressional District. Learn more here:    … #Sayfie Even if you don’t agree with anything else @realDonaldTrump says or does,if you care about returning security,prosperity & democracy to the people of #Venezuela you have to give him credit for paying attention to & taking action on this crisis. … Understand complaint that penalizing hard hits have turned it into a different game. But if parents continue keeping kids away from football at the current rate,one day won’t have any football to complain about. Remember, we don’t have Lithuanian RB’s or Japanese QBs in @NFL. 2/2 I LOVE FOOTBALL. Played it,coached it, parent of 2 players & fanatically support @GatorsFB & the undefeated @MiamiDolphins (#FinsUp). It is a valuable tool to teach important life lessons & helps builds pride & sense of community in schools & cities like no other sport. 1/2 Support local control as much as possible. But 5G Internet isn’t just a telecomm issue, its a natl & eco security one. Whoever sets the global standard on 5G will have incredible leverage on global economy & tremendous advantage in geopolitics & military. … Good job by @RepMcGovern & @RepHultgren getting the Reciprocal Access to #Tibet Act. @SenatorBaldwin & I are working hard to make sure we get this on @Potus desk before end of the year. … #Maduro regime in #Venezuela is a threat to our national security: 1. They traffic cocaine into the U.S.; 2. Inviting #China & #Russia to increase presence in W. Hemisphere;  3. Destabilizing our allies in region by creating massive migrant crisis. … Avert my eyes from what is worthless;by your way give me life. Psalms 119:37 .aronberg we have good news! Just got final word that my bill we have been working on together,to go after the kickbacks feeding these sober home abuses, is going to be part of the final #Opioid bill agreed to between the House & Senate. Thanks for your help & input. #Sayfie … Also keep an eye on the ministry of oil position. For #Iran having a supporter in that position is almost as important as prime minister. If someone backed by Iran gets that position,it becomes a source of revenue & a tool to evade U.S. sanctions. … Has taken too long for final passage of these measures that would help address #Florida's Algal Blooms but yesterday we secured the signatures we needed to bring the bill to a vote in the Senate. Expect a final vote very soon.   #Sayfie Strangers & Citizens by @reihan appears to offer common sense on immigration: 1. Robust legal immigration system that is based on the best interest of the America of today & tomorrow; 2. With laws that are enforced;&  3. That promote assimilation … Not true that sanctions have helped Maduro successfully argue that he is victim of an “economic war’’. Same argument always used to oppose sanctions on left wing regimes. #Venezuela people know sanctions are on individuals & regime is cause of suffering … Those being sanctioned because of Maduro should know that a path exists for some of you (but not all of you) to getting them lifted. Take meaningful action to restore democracy,refuse to violate human rights & speak out against the regimes abuses. … People are starving & dying because Maduro wont allow aid to enter #Venezuela. Today we filed a new law to help migrants who have fled his crimes,expand humanitarian relief for those inside Venezuela & increase economic,political & diplomatic pressure on the Maduro regime. A 2nd meeting with #KimJongUn about what? His “concessions” so far are symbolic such as closing a rocket engine test center he doesn’t need anymore. #KJU trying to play us. To make himself appear accommodating to undermine intl support for sanctions. … Vote for ⁦@mattcaldwell_fl⁩ for #Florida Agriculture Commissioner. He is a 7th generation Floridian who will do a great job for our states farmers & consumers.  … #Sayfie El @USTreasury hoy impuso sanciones a más miembros del régimen de Maduro en #Venezuela: - Cilia Flores - Delcy Rodriguez - Jorge Rodriguez - Vladimiro Padrino y se apoderó de un avión Gulfstream propiedad de Rafael Sarria, secuaz de Diosdado Cabello As promised @USTreasury⁩ today imposed sanctions on more members of Maduro regime in #Venezuela: - Cilia Flores - Delcy Rodriguez - Jorge Rodriguez - Vladimiro Padrino & seized a Gulfstream plane owned by Rafael Sarria, the frontman for Diosdado Cabello  … Whoever pursues justice and kindness will find life and honor. Proverbs 21:21 This is horrifying & difficult to watch. A reminder of the real atrocities being committed every day in many parts of the world. Excellent work by @BBCAfrica piecing all the information together. Hopefully it will lead to true justice for those responsible. … Foundation of church’s authority is Apostolic Succession,the power given by Christ to the apostles to “bind & loose” on earth which has been passed down in an unbroken line to our bishops. How does giving a govt veto power over bishops not break that line? … “No one who lights a lamp conceals it with a vessel or sets it under a bed;rather,he places it on a lampstand so that those who enter may see the light. For there is nothing hidden that will not become visible,& nothing secret that will not be known & come to light.” Luke 8:16-17 #SpeedKills #FinsUp #FindaWaytoWin #3&0 … SOME TRICKERATION TO TAKE THE LEAD!   » @CBS #OAKvsMIA #FinsUppic.twitter.com/DicynKvKuG  @ryantannehill1 drops a dime to @KSTiLLS for SIX  » @CBS #OAKvsMIA | #FinsUppic.twitter.com/E4qsCByxgd .@minkfitz_21 has arrived!   #FinsUppic.twitter.com/Vj9YNAMCvn Have you ever seen a center with so much swag? pic.twitter.com/XrlJ4GkNia ...if you have bitter jealousy & selfish ambition in your hearts,do not boast & be false to the truth...this ...does not come down from above but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.

James 3:14-16 Hosted a roundtable in #Kissimmee #Florida to hear about & discuss continued recovery efforts in #PuertoRico & impact on #CentralFlorida. Significant challenges remain & I am committed to supporting the long-term stability of our fellow Americans on the island. #Sayfiepic.twitter.com/lNtl4NZzES Strongly support @POTUS new Cyber Doctrine. A cyber attack is one of our nation’s greatest vulnerabilities. It is crucial our adversaries know that any cyber attack or meddling in elections,govt networks or critical infrastructure will be met with strong & meaningful retaliation. For it is loyalty that I desire, not sacrifice, and knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings. Hosea 6:6 Three years ago #China leader promised that “there is no intention to militarize” the South China Sea. Then they went ahead & did it. Why would we believe the promises of Chinese leaders on trade or anything else for that matter? … The death of Wendy Martinez is so senseless, tragic & heartbreaking. She was born in #Nicaragua & raised in #Florida. Now the life & career ahead of her was cut short. Can’t even begin to imagine the pain those who loved her are going through. Please keep them in your prayers. One year ago today #HurricaneMaria devastated #PuertoRico. We must help our fellow Americans on the island recover from both the economic crisis & storm damage. And both federal & local officials must learn from the mistakes made so it never happens again … It met with @jccalleja today who is running to be the next President of #ElSalvador. The current left wing government has made some terrible decisions that have hurt the relationship between our two countries. I am hopeful that will change after the next election in El Salvador.pic.twitter.com/fcIdIz5A9N A PR move designed to undermine support for intl sanctions: #KJU offers to decommission plant that makes fissile material in exchange for unspecified U.S. concessions. Sounds generous but in reality is meaningless because he has already produced nukes. … Any citizen who without authority of the U.S. commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign govt or any officer or agent thereof...with intent to defeat the measures of the U.S...shall be fined or imprisoned not more than 3 years or both #LoganAct … Will be on @FoxNews at 8:20AM Eastern Time to discuss why I have asked Justice Department to look into John Kerry negotiating with #Iran in potential violation of U.S. law. Pleased ⁦@TheJusticeDept⁩ followed up on my letter from January & ordered #China state run media operating in the U.S. to register as foreign agents. China uses them to influence opinions abroad,including here. … Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures...he was buried...he was raised on the 3rd day...he appeared to Cephas,then to the Twelve...he appeared to more than 500 brothers at once...he appeared to James,then to all the apostles. 1 Cor 15:3-7 Passionate but orderly people came to protest #SaltBae in #Miami. Not because he fed a socialist. But because he gleefully promoted himself & his business with a video of him catering to a man carrying out a crime against humanity by systematically starving their loved ones. … As we work on more $ for #Florida water projects important we document that Algae isn’t just environmental & economic crisis,its a public health one. Child of friend visiting from out of state was taken to hospital recently after having a severe reaction. … Proud early member of #TeamJohnJames. He’s a top notch candidate. Many in national media fawn over a #Texas Democrat running for Senate only to raise his profile,but they ignore a #WestPoint grad,combat veteran & successful businessman running to serve his country.  #LetsFlyMI … Greatest immediate threat facing #Florida is water quality.  #AlgaeBlooms & #RedTide are having a devastating environmental,economic & public health impact. Senate will pass #WRDA bill very soon. But much more needs to be done. Watch video here:   #sayfie In case you were wondering whether there would be protests at the Miami restaurant over #SaltBae hosting Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in Turkey, here’s your answer. @MiamiHerald @MiamiHeraldFoodpic.twitter.com/qjly65zg12 I sent a letter to #Apple today asking why they didn’t  immediately respond to reports it received about an app, Adware Doctor, covertly sending customers’ browsing histories to servers in #China. … This was always the danger in POTUS meeting with #KJU.  His goal is to destroy support for intl sanctions. So he offers to denuke in return for unspecified concessions,gets Moon to agree,gets good headlines & will now try to make U.S. look unreasonable.  Balance of power between the U.S. & #China is about more than just trade & military. If China surpasses the U.S., then the most powerful government on earth would be the one that aggressively persecutes Catholicism, Buddhism, Protestantism, Daoism & Islam … On this day you shall not do any work, because it is the Day of Atonement, when atonement is made for you before the LORD, your God. Leviticus 23:28 Pleased to see that today @TheJusticeDept⁩ followed up on our letter earlier this year & ordered key Chinese state media firms to register as foreign agents … pic.twitter.com/kMu53EkWI9 A Venezuelan resident protested in front of #SaltBae @nusr_ett⁩ -Et Steakhouse in #Miami & demanded “a public & immediate apology”for promoting his restaurant using video of him providing a feast for the criminal who is starving the people of #Venezuela … Why the outrage over Maduro's lavish steak dinner Turkey?   Back home, Maya Bello has lost 70 pounds in three years.  Her youngest son was severely malnourished until a charity provided food alternatives.  I'll have their story this pm on @WPLGLocal10.pic.twitter.com/nlh9l4S0QR For comparison, while Maduro was tucking into a gourmet meal in Istanbul, in a public hospital in Caracas children were given plain rice for lunch. Thanks to govt economic 'reforms', there is virtually no meat on sale to the public right now. … More context for the video of Maduro wolfing steak in Istanbul: here are the figures showing how much less Venezuelans are eating since he took office. Per capita meat consumption down by over a quarter, for instance. by 2017. … Famous cartoon artist Edo captures the collective sentiment today by drawing Nusret sprinkling salt on scraps of food Venezuelans have pulled out of a garbage bag #Venezuela  … … Estoy de acuerdo con el nuevo embajador de #Colombia “todas las opciones” deben estar sobre la mesa para lidiar con la crisis en #Venezuela … This opinion column gets it backwards. It’s #China that doesn’t want a deal. They are confident that while they can suppress domestic pressure created by trade dispute, in U.S. consumer pain & pressure from Wall St & business groups will force a surrender. … #China has now basically run out of new tariffs to impose in retaliation for U.S. actions. The price of these actions on Americans will be real & significant. But the price of allowing China to continue to gut our economy is infinitely greater. … I suppose now all the elected officials that called on @nikkiHaley to be investigated & the activists that called on her to resign based on this unfair & inaccurate reporting will now issue apologies? … Maduro wants to talk about visit to #China but the suffering people of #Venezuela want to talk about his lavish dinner at Salt Bae's restaurant. He has starved & oppressed 2.3 million people out of the country & another 1 million possible before years end … Has N. Korea's Kim won a propaganda coup?  Not yet, but he is working on it. Moon’s standing at home is tied to tensions with North subsiding. He appears willing to break with U.S. on talks & accept a long term step by step process of denuclearization.  … … South Korea’s Moon embraced by Kim in Pyongyang in bid to revive nuclear talks. All designed by #KJU to drive a wedge in the U.S.-S.Korea alliance. … Sad you don’t see the big difference between shaming someone because you disagree on a political issue & shaming a celebrity chef,who didn’t just host Maduro,he promoted videos of the lavish feast he provided for a criminal that is systematically starving the people of #Venezuela … We have introduced a new bipartisan Senate bill to reimpose sanctions on #ZTE. We should not allow #China the opportunity to use its telecommunication companies to spy on the U.S. & steal our intellectual property. … I have asked the @TheJusticeDept to determine if John Kerry has violated federal laws by meeting with Iranian officials in an effort to save the #IranDeal.   … #FoxNews May those who seek to destroy my life be shamed and confounded. Turn back in disgrace those who desire my ruin. Psalms 40:15 #Salt Bae @nusr_ett⁩ deleted the tweet with the video of him lavishing dictator Maduro with a steak dinner while the people of #Venezuela starve. Fortunately @miamiherald downloaded it before he deleted it. Watch here: … Maduro se da banquete de carnes y el famoso chef Salt Bae lo agasaja como un rey … While some like @nusr_ett feed dictators like Nicolas Maduro, others are helping to feed innocent children being starved by the Maduro regime in #Venezuela. … This guy @nusr_ett who admires dictator @NicolasMaduro so much actually owns a steakhouse in, of all places, #Miami. It’s called NUSR-ET STEAKHOUSE MIAMI  located at 999 Brickell Avenue, Miami, FL 33131  The phone number is 1 305 415 9990 in case anyone wanted to call.  … I don’t know who this weirdo #Saltbae is, but the guy he is so proud to host is not the President of #Venezuela. He is actually the overweight dictator of a nation where 30% of the people eat only once a day & infants are suffering from malnutrition.  … Will miss @TheWendyGrant who passed away today. She lived each day,even her final ones,with the spirit of joy. She gave countless hours to so many good causes,none more than @StJude. I am sure God has already put her in charge of the daily birthday email in heaven. R.I.P.  Wendypic.twitter.com/P59utpghj3 Dr. Ford has made very troubling allegations that must be fully heard. Judge Kavanaugh has strongly denied them & should be given the opportunity to respond. I agree with the decision by @ChuckGrassley to provide both parties the opportunity to do so. Please pray today for the family of Ari Fuld, a citizen of the U.S. & #Israel who was mortally stabbed by a terrorist. As he was dying he was able to incapacitate his killer thereby saving the life of other innocent civilians. May his memory be a blessing. … The wise store up knowledge,but the mouth of a fool is imminent ruin. Proverbs 10:14 Strike a pose.    #MIAvsNYJ | #FinsUppic.twitter.com/TfX1sqhRVk Hopefully #Iran hires John Kerry to be their lead negotiator. Because he is certain to negotiate a bad deal for whichever side he is on. … Here is a reminder of who the Vatican has apparently agreed to give veto power to on the appointment of Bishops, a govt in #China that destroys crosses & burns bibles. … We are praying for Gods protection for our fellow Americans in #NorthCarolina & #SouthCarolina. So many of you helped us after #Hurricanes in #Florida, now we stand ready to help you in any way we can. … Had a great time campaigning with .@VoteMarsha today. I look forward to serving with her in the U.S. Senate.pic.twitter.com/JLZ115zqfF .@VoteMarsha will be a great Senator. If you live in #Tennessee please vote for her. Even if you don’t you can help by donating to her campaign here:  … … How can Vatican justify this doctrinally? They are giving a government (an atheist one) influence in choosing Bishops which “are regarded as transmitters of the apostolic line.” How does secular (& atheist)interference in that decision not break that line? … Correct! Government is already paying some #PaidFamilyLeave costs. Our plan actually holds the real potential of saving that money by allowing new parents the option of drawing on their own social security benefits early. … Letters: Rubio Is Right, It’s Your Own Social Security Money. 100% … Thank you Mayor Kelli Glass Leighton for writing this. We are only one step away from passing the federal water bill that has so many important projects in it. I am increasingly confident we will get this done. Lets keep pushing.  … #Sayfie Want an example of subtle ways media pushes their bias? See this completely false & misleading headline about ⁦@nikkihaley. They are not “her curtains” & buried deep in story is the fact that this purchase was made under Obama administration. … Statements by “scientists” sent by #Cuba regime are a joke. We have 1000’s diplomats worldwide but only in Cuba did over 20 of them suffer brain injuries. U.S. gov employees heavily monitored in Cuba,no way over 20 hurt & regime not know who did it & how. … The tongue of the wise pours out knowledge, but the mouth of fools spews folly. Proverbs 15:2 Not surprised at the sick & twisted excuse coming from a brutal totalitarian regime in #China. I will continue pushing for #GlobalMagnitsky sanctions on the government officials responsible for this atrocious policy. … For some reason I didn’t see this video on the national shows or mention of it in the newspapers. I guess only certain narratives are of interest to them. … We have been warning about the threat from #DeepFakes for some time now. I am glad to see it is now getting some bi-partisan attention in the House as well.  … … So it was wrong to prohibit enriching a #Cuba military guilty of human rights abuses & tyranny because we have some businesses that can make some money off it? And if American trade & tourism promoted democracy, #China would be one by now. … These days even tragedy becomes political. 3k more Americans died in #PuertoRico after Hurricane than during comparable periods before. Both Fed & local gov made mistakes. We all need to stop the blame game & focus on recovery, helping those still hurting & fixing the mistakes. … I remember, not long ago, when we begged people to care about politics & government. Now, that is all everyone wants to talk about, everywhere, all the time:   … #axiosam The deployment of 5G is not just a matter of convenience. It’s not just about being able to watch more streaming video. Much of the innovation that will drive the 21st century will depend on 5g. If America falls behind we will pay a huge price. … You formed my inmost being;you knit me in my mother’s womb....My very self you know...When I was being made in secret, fashioned in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw me unformed; in your book all are written down; my days were shaped, before one came to be. Psalms 139:13-16 The never ending threats from #China should be the top issue we focus on every day. Instead we waste our days arguing with each other, often over the trivial & the absurd while another country is gutting us. I hope we wake up before it’s too late. … #Venezuelapic.twitter.com/9b282SZ9M0 3. In addition to severe budget crisis, the island electric grid & services had already been weakened by Irma just a few weeks before. The cumulative effect of 2 storms was a real factor. We need to learn the lessons from this & make changes for future. 3/3 It took too long for DOD to take charge because of resistance from both DC & Govt. of P.R.  2. Coordinating with local officials was difficult because the govt. of island itself was a victim of the storm. No ability to communicate with Mayor’s, in some cases for weeks. 2/3 Early response to #PuertoRico Hurricane wasn’t good,but not because Fed Govt. didn’t care: 1. The @fema model used on mainland doesn’t work as well on island. Why I called for @DeptofDefense to take control just days after the storm. 1/3 The @WhiteHouse & @POTUS deserve credit for taking this action. They did as much as they could do with an executive order but are limited from going further without legislation. We still need the #DeterAct & are open to making reasonable changes to pass it … No @NFL player does more community service than @KStills of the @MiamiDolphins. You don’t have to agree with how or why he has chosen to exercise the 1st Amendment before every game to acknowledge the hours he gives voluntarily,on his day off,to serve his fellow Americans. … We made many good friends in #SouthCarolina & #NorthCarolina in 2016. We are thinking about you today as you make final preparations for #HurricaineFlorence & stand ready to help in any way in the weeks & months after the storm has passed. It takes an impressive level of stupidity to argue that backing a rebellion to remove an illegitimate tyranny makes it harder for America to advocate credibly on behalf of democracy.

Being outrageous equals clicks,viewers & therefore ratings & $ for media & fame for politicians. Being normal gets you ignored & a primary challenger for being “too weak”. Barack Obama at a speech at American University accused those who opposed #IranDeal of making common cause with those in Iran who chant “Death to America”. Barack Obama in a Univision interview calling on Hispanics to vote against GOP “enemies”: “If Latinos sit out the election instead of saying, ‘We’re gonna punish our enemies and we’re gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us...” Barack Obama justifying ignoring constitution limits on the power of President: “Middle-class families can’t wait for Republicans in Congress to do stuff. So sue me.” Barack Obama on people left behind by new economy: “And it’s not surprising then they get bitter,they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.” How about when he made a joke about former First Lady  Nancy Reagan conducting seances?  Pres. Obama is right. It is wrong for a President to use divisive language, such as: 1.  Call all opponents of same-sex marriage bigots 2. Call the Pro-Life movement a "War on Women" 3. Call all immigration enforcement advocates racists 4.

The giddy reaction by some to the op-ed in @nyt shows how, for far too many people, on both sides, partisan animosity has overtaken a commitment to our constitutional republic. America has one duly elected president. Anybody serving at his pleasure should do so faithfully. When they feel they no longer can, they should resign & speak in their own name so the country can evaluate their insights with a full understanding of where they are coming from. Pleased to see @SBAgov followed up on our request two weeks ago & is now ready to provide aid to small businesses affected by toxic algae.   … via @tcpalm #Sayfie … He frustrates the plans of the cunning,so that their hands achieve no success; He catches the wise in their own ruses, and the designs of the crafty are routed. Job 5: 12-13 Today I asked Facebook & @Twitter if they intend to uphold the American values of freedom of expression if asked to violate it by authoritarian governments. #Facebook said yes, but #Twitter..... well you watch video & decide:  Many opposing #KavanaughForSCOTUS are doing so because of what they think his position is on hot button political issues. But if confirmed his job won’t be to make policy decisions on these issues,his job will be to decide if the policy decisions of lawmakers are constitutional Quick update as I head to today’s #tech hearing with #Twitter and #Facebook execs.pic.twitter.com/NYVCsGsPZQ This morning,after watching circus at #SCOTUS hearing & reading stories about Woodward book,the burning of #Nike gear & debate over whether the “ok” sign is racist, the leaders of #China must be thinking to themselves “overtaking America is going to be easier than we thought!” You have been snared by the utterance of your lips, caught by the words of your mouth; Proverbs 6:2 Rubio Moves the Ball Forward on #PaidFamilyLeave Read it here: … The U.S. & #NorthKorea are at a stalemate for one simple reason, Kim Jong-un never had any intention to reach a nuclear disarmament deal. He wanted to weaken support for sanctions by appearing “reasonable” & making U.S. appear unreasonable. … As squalls begin to impact the great #FloridaPanhandle reminding everyone to stay off the roads today & be safe.

Proverbs 14:23 “But what comes out of a person,that is what defiles. From within people,from their hearts,come evil thoughts, unchastity,theft,murder,adultery,greed,malice,deceit, licentiousness,envy, blasphemy,arrogance,folly. All these evils come from within and they defile.” Mark 7:20-23 Red Tide & Algae Blooms aren’t just ruining the summer in SW #Florida, they threaten to destroy its economy & way of life. We are working hard to get this solved,but we have long road ahead. This must happen. Watch the vide here:   #Sayfie Just left a moving service at the U.S. Capitol for the late @SenJohnMcCain. Even in death he rendered one last public service to America, he reminded us that you can serve the nation with passion & strong convictions without abandoning integrity & decency.  R.I.P. my friend.pic.twitter.com/7e65pAKhg1 This is total lunacy. And a disservice at a time when our people need reminders of what we can achieve when we work together. The American people paid for that mission,on rockets built by Americans,with American technology & carrying American astronauts. It wasn’t a UN mission. … We are so focused on politics & outrage that we overlook the fact that extraordinary Americans are making an impact in our communities. Like this volunteer choir in #Florida that performs for & brings comfort to the terminally ill. May God bless them. … Every President in last 25 years promised to confront #China for cheating on trade. You don’t have to support everything or even anything else @realdonaldtrump does or says to recognize the fact that he is the first one who actually did it. … Muslim governments around the world & liberal activists here at home loudly condemned what they called the U.S.  “Muslim Travel Ban”, but they have been far less outraged as #China cracks down on #Uighur minority with mass detention camps.  … via @bpolitics #China is transferring huge amounts of wealth from the U.S.. I will soon be filing a new bill to end the ‘China hustle’ by requiring Chinese companies that want to list on stock exchanges or access capital markets to comply with our laws. Enough is enough. … This morning I wrote about why #PaidFamilyLeave is so important for our nations future. Nothing is more important than strong families & strong parents with the time & resources they need to raise healthy,productive & responsible Americans. … Therefore I will again deal with this people in surprising and wondrous fashion: The wisdom of the wise shall perish,the prudence of the prudent shall vanish.  Isaiah 29:14 Mourning the passing of Jonathan Graham, a good friend and great person who was taken from us much too soon. May God bless his family, his wife Dria & their unborn son. … #RedTide is indeed naturally occurring. But the frequency & intensity of what we have seen the last two years merits further study into whether nutrients & pollution may be making it even worse. That is what we are working on. … Earlier this morning visited the #St.Lucie Locks & Dam. The #Algae bloom crisis is devastating communities on both the #TreasureCoast & #SWFlorida.

El gobierno izquierdista de #ElSalvador pronto perderá la ayuda de EE.UU., no quiero que eso suceda también en Guatemala. There was no greater support of @NATO than @SenJohnMcCain. I am drafting a Senate resolution supporting the naming of new #NATO HQ after him & calling on @USNATO to support this move. As McCain loved to say when asked why he held a certain position “it is the right thing to do”. Heard that people close to President of #Guatemala @jimmymoralesgt are pushing him to switch from #Taiwan to #China. I hope he doesn’t listen to them. Leftist Anti-American govt of #ElSalvador will soon lose U.S. foreign aid don’t want that to happen to Guatemala as well. If you have foolishly been proud or presumptuous—put your hand on your mouth; For as the churning of milk produces curds, and the pressing of the nose produces blood, the churning of anger produces strife.

Please go online and Sign the Petition!   via @Change Here is one more for the decision makers at ⁦@MDCollege⁩, this one is from earlier this year in the Washington Post. … Maybe @MDCollege administrators didn’t read this one about how Confucius Institutes censor political discussions & restrain the free exchange of ideas on college campuses.  @thenation … Maybe ⁦@MDCollege⁩ leaders didn’t read about how  #China’s government offered Stanford University $4 million to host a Confucius Institute with one caveat: No discussions of delicate issues like #Tibet … Maybe administrators at @MDCollege missed this 2014 statement from the American Association of University Professors warning that Confucius Institutes threaten academic freedom | AAUP:  … I didn’t see this article posted on the ⁦@MDCollege⁩ website. I wonder how many students are aware that “the FBI is also “watching warily” activities at dozens of Confucius Institutes”  Read more here:  … … Unlike ⁦@MDCollege⁩ a growing number of schools have broken with Confucius Institutes because they “function as peripheral propaganda branches of the Chinese party-state.” … I hope the administration at @MDCollege will ask the Confucius Institute on campus to hold a symposium on the mass roundup of Muslims in #Xinjiang region & invites to speak the families of those held in these internment camps. Why don’t you ask them & see what they say? … Compare actions of @MDCollege admin with that of @UofNorthFlorida which recently cut ties with Confucius Institute.  Taxpayer funded higher education should not be a forum for foreign influence campaigns, especially from a serial human rights violator like #China government. They don’t ask because @MDCollege admin doesn’t want to lose the $ #China government gives them through the Confucius Institute. They use it to influence faculty & students towards China’s narrative on global events including #Tibet, #Taiwan etc. on our taxpayer funded campuses. .@MDCollege admin very proud of partnership with Chinese govt’s Confucius Institute & recently sent 22 students to “study” in #China. Why don’t they ask the “prestigious” Confucius Institute about the Muslim  internment camps in the #Xinjiang region? … Today I & a bipartisan group of 16 members of Congress asked ⁦@POTUS⁩ to use the Global Magnitsky Act to freeze the as­sets & ban the en­try of Chinese officials responsible for the mass roundup of Muslims in internment camps in the #Xinjiang region … #Putin has carefully cultivated image as a popular leader in #Russia. But he faces growing discontent that while his elite friends are making billions off corruption,the people face troop deaths in foreign wars,pension cuts & high youth employment … Sorry.

Do not regard him as an enemy but admonish him as a brother. 2 Thes 3:6,14-15 Rick Scott is officially our nominee for U.S. Senate! We need him to keep the Senate in GOP hands & grow our majority. He will be a great Senator for #Florida. Let’s help him win in November. #Sayfie Cancelling August recess resulted in the most productive Senate work period in recent memory. Today alone we confirmed seven more judges & 27 executive branch nominees (including a U.S. Attorney & 2 U.S. Marshalls from #Florida). Next week we will confirm another 8 judges. Great job @mattcaldwell_fl winning tonight’s GOP nomination for Agriculture Commissioner of #Florida. I am proud to be your friend and supporter and can’t wait until you win in November! #sayfie Congratulations to @Mike_Miller_FL on your victory tonight. You will make a great congressman. But first lets fo win in November! #Sayfie Very happy to see that @JavierSoutoD10 was reelected to represent District 10. You do a great job and Miami-Dade County will benefit from 4 more years of your service. Great job! Congratulations to @CommishDiaz on your reelection tonight. The residents of your district recognized your hard work and dedication with 4 more years. You earned it! Congratulations to @RebecaSosaMiami. You are a great commissioner & an even better friend. No one works harder for the people they represent than you do. Very happy the voters of your district (which includes me!) recognized that tonight with this big win. Congratulations to @RepDeSantis on his victory tonight!Now on to victory in November. You will be a great governor.  @adamputnam is a good man with a great record of public service to #Florida, he will be back. #Sayfie Mexico has used every trick in the book to wipe out #Florida vegetable growers. It looks like under the new trade deal announced by @potus they will keep getting away with it. That needs to be changed or this is not a good deal for Florida or America. … Chinese spy company was rightfully barred by Congress from getting any U.S. govt contracts. So what did #China do? They hired Mercury Public Affairs,the go-to lobbyists for war criminals,human rights abusers & U.S. adversaries to try & change the law.   … Ortega regime supported by enablers & family members & we know who you are. Time to impose sanctions on Laureano Ortega Murillo,Karen Santamaria,Rafael Ortega Murrillo & Yadira Leets. We should also allow Ortega & family to be sued in U.S. courts for human rights violations. I can’t imagine a more important item for us to be concerned about as a nation than a foreign country interfering in our elections or trying to stir up strife among our people. Yet we can’t seem to find time for #DeterAct in committee or on Senate floor? The sentencing of Russian activist Alexei Navalny to 30 days in jail is no surprise. He has exposed how elites close to #Putin are getting rich off corruption while retirees suffer & 50% of nation’s unemployed are young Russians under 35. … I never had much hope for talks with #KJU because I knew #NorthKorea wasn’t serious about denuclearization. That said @potus took a gamble & bent over backwards to try & find a peaceful resolution. But this effort, like all the ones before,failed, & Kim Jong un is 100% at fault. pic.twitter.com/vWOQZZRIn9 Then let all the trees of the forest rejoice before the LORD who comes,who comes to govern the earth,To govern the world with justice and the peoples with faithfulness. Psalms 96:12-13 As I feared, #KJU has found a split between the U.S. & #SouthKorea he will now fully exploit to weaken sanctions & the U.S. position. It appears the govt of South Korea is moving forward with opening an Inter-Korean Liaison Office with #NorthKorea over the objections of the U.S. The moves made by @NicolasMaduro are causing serious & lasting damage to the private sector in #Venezuela. But it is not an accident. His goal is to eliminate the private sector & leave his regime with complete control over the economy & the lives of the people. He will fail. Pleased that @POTUS has signed the proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until Sunday in honor of the late @SenJohnMcCain.  This week should be about his 60 years of service to America, and nothing else. Briefed today by @JSOPIO @FBIJacksonville & @ATFHQ on the #JacksonvilleShooting & the gang related shooting on Friday at high school football game & thanked them for their excellent response. Also went to @MemorialJax to thank incredible doctors & nurses for treating the injuredpic.twitter.com/PUdlOSvtEH After seeing algal bloom & #redtide damage up close in Captiva, headed back to D.C. later today to continue working on our bi-partisan South #Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act. … Student loan crisis threatens to hold back an entire generation. Which is why for 4 years I have been pushing bi-partisan #RightToKnowBeforeYouGo. Students deserve to know what they can expect to make with a degree before they borrow money to pay for it.  Sadly, the world has grown increasingly numb to atrocities such as those in #Myanmar where military officials have committed genocide & war crimes on an epic scale. … Terrible weekend for #Jacksonville #Florida. Gang violence at high school game on Friday, then violence at ESport event on Sunday. I have no problem focusing on WHAT was used to commit violence. But we should also start focusing more on WHY people commit violence. Let the heavens be glad & the earth rejoice;let the sea & what fills it resound;let the plains be joyful & all that is in them...let all the trees of the forest rejoice before the LORD who comes to govern the world with justice & the peoples with faithfulness Psalm 96:11-13 Have confirmed @FBI & @ATFHQ are in contact & in coordination with local authorities to provide any & all federal resources needed to respond to #JacksonvilleLandingShooting. Multiple fatalities at the scene, many transported.  #TheLandingMassShooting … Mass shooting at the Jacksonville Landing.  Stay far away from the area.  The area is not safe at this time.  STAY AWAY #TheLandingMassShooting Horrifying news from #Jacksonville this afternoon. Have spoken to local authorities & am still awaiting more information on this shooting. Situation still unfolding, law enforcement is asking everyone to avoid the area. #Sayfie Those of us who worked with him will miss him. None of us can be John McCain. He had a unique personality & rare life experiences. But this is a good opportunity for all of us to remember the best attributes he brought to the Senate & examine how each of us have fallen short. 5/5 Third,his raw authenticity. I never saw him trying to be someone he was not. Popular or not, he was going to say &/or do what he he thought needed to be said & done. 4/5 Second,his stubborn sense of justice. When he saw something unjust or unfair,nothing stood in the way of speaking his mind & nothing could get him to back down. He was oblivious to politics or public pressure when it came to right & wrong. 3/5 First, his energy & work ethic. He could grind long hours for days on end. An overseas trip with @SenJohnMcCain started at 6am & ended at midnight. And if he found any open time on the itinerary he would add some new meeting or unexpected side visit. 2/5 I only knew @SenJohnMcCain from TV before I was elected in 2010. The man I came to know personally was someone who made a deep impact on me. It wasn’t the issues that left a mark,we agreed on many but disagreed on more than a few. It was the three things. 1/5 I am a great admirer of the hard working people of #ElSalvador. It’s my hope that one day soon they will have a government that provides them security, opportunity & prosperity & does not stand in the way of the bonds of affection between the U.S. & Salvadoran people. … After our water tour I sat down with local leaders including @lizbethkb @DaneEagle & Lee County Commission Chair Cecil Pendergrass to discuss, among other things, how to address @JaxStrong releasing too much water in the summer, yet not enough in the winter & spring. #Sayfie … Just toured waterways of Sanibel & Captiva with Council members Holly Smith & Jason Maughan to see the fish kills resulting from the red tide outbreak.

I’m certain that at this very moment our valiant guardians of 1st amend,the newspaper editorial boards,are collaborating to take on the growing threat from the digital mob.pic.twitter.com/TMMqXfqcxe Some of our best memories as a family are from our time together at some of the beaches & waterways that have been off limits this summer because of Algae & Red Tide. Fixing this will not be easy or fast,but I will do everything in my power to get it done. … Leftist leaders of #ElSalvador were clearly told ahead of time that switching from #Taiwan to #China would have negative impact on relations with U.S., but they either didn’t believe it or didn’t care. They will soon find out that this @POTUS doesn’t bluff … I see the outrage mob has successfully enforced their speech code on yet another American. I am curious to know exactly which tweet of mine did he have to apologize for liking? … The LORD is just in all his ways,merciful in all his works. The LORD is near to all who call upon him,to all who call upon him in truth.He fulfills the desire of those who fear him;he hears their cry and saves them. Psalms 145:17-19 The crisis in #Venezuela has evolved into a national security threat to the U.S. that must be addressed. The Maduro regime is an organized crime syndicate that traffics drugs onto our streets, is driving a dangerous migratory crisis & has invited #Putin to open military bases. The humanitarian crisis in #Venezuela is wholly created by a dictator & his cronies. And it has triggered a mass migration that may soon surpass the number of people who fled #Syria & that threatens to destabilize various neighboring countries. … Very productive day. We successfully got another $1 million for CDC to deal with #Florida red tide/algae blooms & we filed a new bill to require the Interagency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms to create an action plan to respond to them.   … #Sayfie Great to see the world is waking up to the threat posed by telecomm from #China. #Australia has banned #Huawei & #ZTE from its next-generation wireless network. Very smart move. … In #Venezuela the large street demonstrations of the past have been replaced by “flash mob” protests. Very Smart! Maduro regime needs advance notice to disrupt protests. They would really struggle to deal with numerous & simultaneous protests they didn’t have time to prepare for. Conditions throughout all of #Venezuela are dire under the Maduro dictatorship,but they are particularly bad in the western part of the country. For example much of #Zulia state has been without electric power for 2 weeks. Growing unrest is brewing in this part of the country. Just spoke to @SBALinda about impact of red tide/algae blooms on #Florida small businesses. I asked that @SBAgov open Business Recovery Center(s) quickly so businesses can apply for Disaster Loans. Also pushing for a seperate red tide/algae bloom disaster declaration. #Sayfie While many working parents have no paid leave for children,some cosmopolitan elites get “fur-ternity” leave for new pets. This isn’t the result of “market forces”.  It’s the result of decades of indifference to the challenges facing working Americans. … At 11:30 am I will be at ⁦⁦@WhiteHouse⁩ to discuss CFIUS Reform & the broader need to address the national security threat posed to the U.S. by #China. We want a fair & balanced relationship with China, that is not what we have now. … So crossbred Burmese & Indian pythons may become a #Everglades “super snake.“ Why does it always have to happen to #Florida? Can we catch just one break? #Sayfie … I support LNG exports. But transport,especially through heavily populated areas,must be in accordance with highest safety standards possible. I am checking with federal agencies right now to make sure those standards are being met & regularly monitored. … Fiscalia de EEUU congela mansión vinculada al testaferro de los hijastros de el dictador de #Venezuela Maduro en caso de “los Bolichicos” … Diosdado Cabello utilizó más de 350 empresas para lavar $1,300 millones que se robo de el pueblo de #Venezuela … Hearing about a spanish language commercial in #Miami that leaves false impression I am opposing Commissioner Pepe Diaz in his reelection campaign. This is 100% false. I support him & ask the residents of District 12 to vote for him! Also making great progress on 2 other priorities: 1. $10 million grant to strengthen partnerships between universities & low-income school districts to increase the number of mental health professionals in these schools 2. Grant to promote school safety in rural  areas. #Sayfie Making great progress this morning on getting another $1 million of CDC funding to deal with #Florida algae bloom & Red Tide. #Sayfie I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.  Ezekiel 26:36 #RedTide isn’t just an environmental & economic crisis for #Florida, it’s increasingly a public health one. Which is why I am working on additional $1 million from CDC to track the number of people who get sick after being exposed to the red tide toxins. … The Ole Miss story I tweeted was great. But the #GatorNation has two stories like it of our own. … Floyd Allen hurt his knee in high school,had to play in junior college while working at McDonald’s & eventually has to quit playing football & was homeless for a few months. But he got his life together & walked on to the Ole Miss Football team. Then today happened. Watch Video: … Ayer hable con @realDonaldTrump para cortar ayuda económica a gobierno de #ElSalvador sobre #China.   … via @prensagrafica Today we will be working on securing more funding for @CDCgov algae bloom research   via @thenewspress #Sayfie You did not strengthen the weak nor heal the sick nor bind up the injured. You did not bring back the stray or seek the lost but ruled them harshly and brutally. So they were scattered for lack of a shepherd... Ezekiel 34:4-5 Me uní al @SenCoryGardner en una enmienda para terminar con la ayuda extranjera a #ElSalvador después de que su gobierno de izquierda decidiera abandonar a #Taiwán en favor de #China. También hablé con @realdonaldtrump hace unos minutos sobre recortarles la ayuda. I have joined @SenCoryGardner in an amendment to end foreign aid to #ElSalvador after their leftist government decided to abandon #Taiwan in favor of #China. I also spoke to @realdonaldtrump about cutting off their aid just a few minutes ago. Maduro is increasingly a national security threat. The mass migration he has caused is destabilizing neighbors including #Colombia, #Brazil & #Ecuador. Do not be surprised if he invites #Russia Air Force to send bomber on visit & even open up a #Putin base in #Venezuela As expected @NicolasMaduro using drone attack that caused his soldiers to run away scared to justify dictatorship. Making people even more dependant on regime for little they have & opponents inside regime fear he will fabricate evidence implicating them in attack.  #Venezuela  Don’t miss out on breaking news!!

Why should we keep sending them so much foreign aid? Today I will begin work to end that.  Paid family leave could give new parents a much-needed lifeline … As I said yesterday before their decision was announced,their would be real consequences in our relationship with #ElSalvador if they broke with #Taiwan in favor of #China. They think we are going to react the same way we did to #Panama & #DominicanRepublic. They are very wrong. Because you are haughty of heart, you say, “I am a god! I sit on a god’s throne in the heart of the sea!” But you are a man, not a god; yet you pretend you are a god at heart! Ezekiel 28:2 Just finalized a bipartisan proposal we will be offering up tomorrow with Senator Nelson to get an additional $1 million from @CDCgov to mitigate against & respond to toxic algae blooms in #Florida.  #Sayfie If Ortega-Murillo regime in #Nicaragua gets a big loan from #Russia to bail them out of crisis they created, it will confirm what I have been arguing for some time, Ortega is #Putin closest supporter in Latin America & therefore a national security risk to U.S. we must address. The U.S. response to #Panama & #DominicanRepublic switching from #Taiwan to #China is NOT the way we will react if #ElSalvador does the same. If they do this I will have no choice but to immediately begin work to end their funding & remove them from #AllianceForProsperity plan. Would be terrible mistake for govt of #ElSalvador to switch diplomatic recognition from #Taiwan to #China. Maybe they think China $ will help governing party win elections in 2019. But will cause real harm to relationship with U.S. including their role in #AllianceforProsperity Dictator ⁦@NicolasMaduro⁩ “plan” will not “revitalize” the economy of #Venezuela.

We have never been perfect,but we overcame the sins of our past & can overcome our current ones,by fulfilling our founding principle,that all people are created by God with the right to life,liberty & the pursuit of happiness Whoever corrects the arrogant earns insults; and whoever reproves the wicked incurs opprobrium. Proverbs 9:7 .@jaynordlinger always appreciate your insight. My response to hyper-individualism is not a government run “village”.

WATCH HERE:   via @YouTube #poisonpic.twitter.com/3DNbn10EA0 #Poisonpic.twitter.com/jPwbsFfGRl #poisonpic.twitter.com/q7SM1mNpFr This is an excellent interview of ⁦@arthurbrooks⁩. Our culture of treating each other with contempt is poisonous. Our enemies like #Putin are exploiting it & we are ALL guilty of spreading it as the responses sure to follow this tweet will prove. … #China blatantly cheats & steals & 20 years of playing nice doesn’t work. So what are we supposed to do,unconditional surrender? Here is an idea for fair trade,treat China the way they treat us. Same rules on their products & companies as they have on ours … You shall be my people, and I will be your God. Jeremiah 30:22 I saw coming with the clouds of heaven One like a son of man. When he reached the Ancient of Days & was presented before him,He received dominion,splendor & kingship;all nations,peoples & tongues will serve him. Daniel 7:13-14 TODAY: @marcorubio sits down with Chris Wallace for an exclusive interview on @FoxNewsSunday. Check your local listings and tune in to Fox News Channel at 2p ET and 7p ET!pic.twitter.com/XnE7dBnZ4S I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me will never hunger, and whoever believes in me will never thirst. John 6:35 Now, therefore, reform your ways and your deeds; listen to the voice of the LORD your God, so that the LORD will have a change of heart regarding the evil he has spoken against you. Jeremiah 26:13 #Erdogan is upset about U.S. support for Kurds in #Syria. Irony is that his military assault against them pushed Kurds to seek an alliance with Erdogan enemy the Asaad regime,helping a pro-Iran regime consolidate power on #Turkey’s border:  … #axiosworld This is why I encouraged @potus to use recent trade truce with @EUCouncil as opportunity to work with them to confront #China. #Germany just blocked a Chinese acquisition over national security concerns. We aren’t the only ones who see the threat: … Excellent opinion piece. I too wish the U.S. media would give more attention to Ortega regimes kidnappings,murders, firing of doctors for providing care to wounded protesters & many other #HumanRights violations in #Nicaragua.  Absentee ballots will be out soon. If you live in #Florida & are registered to vote in the #GOP primary, I strongly encourage you to vote for @mattcaldwell_fl to be our next Commissioner of Agriculture. #Sayfie I don’t want to fund #PaidFamilyLeave with #SocialSecurity.  I want working American parents to have the OPTION of funding THEIR paid leave by drawing early on a portion of THEIR social security benefits which THEY paid for with THEIR taxes. … Apparently some of my Senate colleagues, who pretended to support sanctions on #ZTE but quickly caved in negotiations with the House, endangering our national security is OK so long as you are willing to pay a one time billion dollar fine. … Trudeau’s pol­icy on refugees fac­ing push­back as 58% in #Canada think country ‘too generous’ to asylum seekers who cross border illegally. A people’s expectation that government will enforce the law & protect the border isn’t bigotry, its sovereignty. … Happy to see ⁦⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ act decisively to DEFEND against #Putin efforts to interfere with our elections & conduct information warfare. The only thing missing is effort to DETER it. Why we need the #DETERact. We must #Defend&Deter … #China uses it’s position on the fraudulent U.N. Human Rights Council, its veto on the @UN Security Council & bribes to developing countries to block international attention to & condemnation of its ethnic cleansing campaign in Xinjiang. #China is carrying out an ethnic cleansing campaign. Hundreds of thousands of #Uighurs in #Xinjiang region have been imprisoned in camps. It is an additional outrage that so far the reaction of the “international community” has largely been silence. … Insult has broken my heart, and I despair; I looked for compassion, but there was none, for comforters, but found none. Instead they gave me poison for my food; and for my thirst they gave me vinegar. Psalms 69: 21-22 A U.S. citizen & engineer at ⁦@generalelectric⁩ linked to a company from #China, stole power plant technology by hiding it in a photo of a sunset. Your daily reminder of how #China steals & uses American trade secrets on a regular basis. … #KimJongUn will continue with moves like these to gain international goodwill & weaken support for sanctions. He may even offer more concessions. But he won’t agree to anything that erodes core weapons capabilities & will hide key parts of his WMD program. … Having children should not be a bankruptcy inducing event. My plan for Paid Family Leave is a creative option that people don't have right now.pic.twitter.com/Hzz7f9OaRt Every time you hear overblown rhetoric about how we are on the verge of “tyranny” or “authoritarianism” in America remember what real tyranny& authoritarianism looks like. In #China the police arrested a Xi critic while he was in the middle of a live interview. … Earlier today I tweeted about how #China hired ⁦@mercury_tweets⁩ to get sanctions relief for #ZTE. Now we learn they were hired by close #Putin operative to lobby ⁦@USTreasury⁩ to reduce sanctions on him. Maybe #Iran will hire them next? … With my Paid Family Leave plan, everyone will have the option of using some of their Social Security benefits early to stay home with their children.pic.twitter.com/N8yQPnghrR 6 reasons to support our #PaidFamilyLeave bill: 1.  Doesn’t expand government 2. Doesn’t add new taxes 3. Doesn’t place mandates on business 4. Doesn’t create a new entitlement 5. Doesn’t crowd out existing benefits 6. DOES help new parents stay in workforce … Would be great if most tariffs & unfair trade barriers went away. But just as “peace through strength” was a good idea,so is “fair trade through strength”. The only way to get #China to drop it’s barriers is to retaliate against them until they do. … In March I filed a bill to go after rogue shark fishing fleets by requiring any country exporting shark products to U.S. to prove that they were harvested legally, sustainably & with enforcement mechanisms certified by ⁦@NOAA⁩ … According to @nytimes the P.R. firm @mercury_tweets⁩ was hired by #China & boasted to clients & prospective clients about how they played a pivotal role in killing #ZTE sanctions & could help other foreign clients being targeted by the government. … I may decree concerning a nation or kingdom that I will build up and plant it;but if that nation does what is evil in my eyes, refusing to obey my voice, then I will have a change of heart regarding the good with which I planned to bless it. Jeremiah 18: 9-10 For years we lowered our trade barriers & allowed #China to raise theirs, believing that once China got rich they would liberalize. That was a mistake. Now,the only way to remove barriers is to demonstrate to them our willingness to retaliate with barriers … In my 7 years in the Senate I have never voted against the National Defense Authorization Act..until today. The decision to cave & allow #ZTE to stay in business in U.S. gives #China an unacceptable ability to threaten our telecommunications network.  Nothing is more conservative than supporting family. And no job in America is more important than being a parent. Today new parents face financial insecurity when they need time away from work without pay. Let's help with an OPTION for #PaidFamilyLeave.  Giving benefit of the doubt until we learn more. But reading how @Google has plans to help #China set up a censored search engine is very disturbing. They won’t help ⁦@DeptofDefense⁩ keep us safe but they will help China suppress the truth? … I support freer & more open trade. But that has to be a two way street. A trade relationship in which only one side is open,isn’t free trade,it’s economic self mutilation. We are finally standing up to #China & Xi Jinping is facing the consequences at home … Sadly we failed this chin check. The U.S. saved #ZTE as a goodwill gesture to Xi. And #China responded to this overly generous gesture of “goodwill” by blocking Qualcomm pur­chase of NXP Semi­con­duc­tors NV even after @Treasury asked them for it in return. Learn the lesson! Happy to see @realDonaldTrump is not backing down on #China. The message is clear “Mr. Xi tear down these tariffs (& intellectual property theft, blocking market access etc. etc.)” Now  is no time for Congress to get weak on this. … We still have some serious structural issues in our economy that need to be addressed long term. But with all the “noise” & daily outrage, why isn’t the fact that U.S. workers got biggest pay increase in nearly a decade getting more attention? … I command you: be strong and steadfast! Do not fear nor be dismayed, for the LORD, your God, is with you wherever you go. Joshua 1:9 #Putin interference is not on behalf of GOP or Dems. It’s 21st century information warfare against the American people. Today’s @Facebook revelations show how an anti-American dictator uses our computers & mobile devices to divide us against each other:  We are very close to getting funding in appropriations bill for research on health impacts of algae blooms. 5m for @EPA to investigate algal bloom toxin & to develop new methods to monitor,characterize & predict blooms. And 200K for @USGS to find ways to diminish toxicity levels. Great example of how solid local journalism can contribute greatly to good public policy. @NickNehamas & @KevinGHall from @MiamiHerald exposed dirty money in Miami real estate. Based significantly on their reporting we are taking action with @SenWhitehouse. #Sayfie … While ⁦@Google⁩ decided not to work with ⁦@DeptofDefense⁩ on #ProjectMaven they have no problem working with a university in #China that provides much of the technology used by the Chinese military. … Those who advocate for unconditional surrender to #China on trade should read this. They are starting to feel the pain too. This can all end if they stop cheating, blocking our companies & stealing our intellectual property. Until then, stay strong! … After an objection prevented passage of a 4 month flood insurance program extension by unanimous consent, we will have a full vote of Senate later today. I expect it will pass & we will need to get @potus to sign before the expiration deadline tonight.  #Sayfie .@realDonaldTrump will be in #Tampa today. We spoke last night about how we can’t let a @US_FDA rule intended for cigarettes put America’s oldest family owned premium cigar maker @JCNewmanCigars out of business after 123 years. @CigarAficMag @CigarAssoc #Sayfie Then we, your people, the sheep of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise. Psalms 79:13 Few people know what a “Deep Fake” video is. But I fear we all know what they are in the not too distant future. Already used overseas by #Russia to create strife, conflict & controversy. It can happen here too. … We must stop playing politics with the reauthorization of flood insurance and get this done now.  House-passed bill does not protect new policy holders if program lapses tomorrow night. Time is running out. This is an unacceptable punishment in the middle of hurricane season. As I said last week this @WhiteHouse isn’t just talk. Today they sanctioned three #OrtegaMurilloRegime officials under #GlobalMagnitskyAct for human rights abuses & corruption. They also revoked & restricted visas of regime officials & their families. #SOSNicaragua #Nicaragua … The narrative #China wants to push is that if we confront their unfair & illegal trade practices the U.S. will feel all the pain & lose. But the truth is our current trade dispute is exposing their vulnerabilities. We need to stay strong. … For they are a fickle generation,children with no loyalty in them! Since they have incited me with a “no-god,” & provoked me with their empty idols, I will incite them with a “no-people”;with a foolish nation I will provoke them. Deut 32: 20-21 Our prayers this morning for the quick recovery of @repjohnlewis. May God restore his health & strength. Get well soon. ...live in a manner worthy of the call you have received,with all humility & gentleness,with patience, bearing with one another through love,striving to preserve the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace.  Ephesians 4:1-3 More criminality from regime in #Nicaragua. Doctors are being fired from their jobs in #León Nicaragua because they treated teenagers injured by paramilitary gangs working for #Ortega and #Murillo. #SOSNicaragua Preocupante escuchar que varios doctores en #León #Nicaragua aparentemente fueron despedidos tras atender a los jóvenes heridos en las protestas en contra de #Ortega y #Murillo.#SOSNicaragua … Next time someone tells you we lag Europe or anyone else on X,Y or Z you can point to one thing we are proud to be lagging the rest of the world on & hope to never catch up: “euthanizing” children as young as 9 years old.    … hat is Happy to report that the Senate has added the reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program to nexts week calendar. We will have a vote next week. Now pushing to make sure vote happens before it expires Tuesday night.   #Sayfie Phil was in my #Tallahassee office today to fill out paperwork so we can help get his ID and social security cards for employment. Proud of my staff, @TallyPD, @cotfire for helping him get back on his feet. We’re rooting for you, Phil! #Sayfie  pic.twitter.com/dQEGxhmaTY Trade issues are nuanced, not simple yes or no proposition: 1. Trade with allies needs to be readjusted & rebalanced; 2. But we should first team up with our allies to take on #China’s cheating & stealing; 3. Then AFTER we deal with China, can work out differences with allies Last remaining cigar factory in #YborCity will soon be shut down due to insane @US_FDA rule. Premium cigar makers & retailers are mostly family owned businesses that will be wiped out unless my Senate colleagues join me in saving them.   … #sayfie .@CommerceGov does #China a favor & reverses ban on ⁩#ZTE buying chips from Qualcomm. And how did China return the favor? By blocking Qualcomm deal with NXP despite the begging & pleading from @USTreasury⁩ & Commerce Dept. We should reimpose ZTE ban. … Hopeful that the trade truce between the U.S. & EU will be followed by a deal on NAFTA & with Japan, so we can unite with them to confront the real threat, #China’s unfair,deceptive & illegal trade practices. … The National Flood Insurance Program is in desperate need of changes. But allowing it to expire next Tuesday without a short term extension, especially in middle of the hurricane season, is not the answer. We need to get this done.   via @YouTube #Sayfie Listen carefully, but do not understand! Look intently, but do not perceive! Make the heart of this people sluggish, dull their ears and close their eyes;Lest they see with their eyes, & hear with their ears,& their heart understand, & they turn & be healed. Isaiah 6:9-10 .@KyleKashuv is a incredibly impressive young man from #Florida. I am very proud of the work he is doing on school safety & with young conservatives. I can’t wait to see what the future has in store for him. … Congratulations to my friend @GeoffDuncanGA on his victory last night in the #GOP runoff. He is going to win in November & be a great Lt. Gov for #Florida’s neighbors & fellow Americans in #Georgia. 100% correct. #China plays hardball & this is the first time someone gives it back to them. For them this isn’t about just trade,they seek economic dominance at our expense. We are running out of time to get some balance. It’s now or never. We need hang tough & together on China … National Flood Insurance program expires in less than a week. This program is badly in need of reform, but letting it expire in the meantime would leave millions of people vulnerable to financial catastrophe smack in the middle of hurricane season. We need to get this done ASAP. “the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them & the great ones make their authority over them felt. But it shall not be so among you. Rather whoever wishes to be great among you shall be your servant;whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave.” Matthew 20:25-27 #Iran chants Death to America,is directly responsible for the IED’s that maimed & killed U.S. soldiers in Iraq & sponsors terror everywhere. So I have no problem with ⁦@POTUS⁩ using clear language reminding them what a bad idea it is to threaten us … This is how #China influences our government policies. They spent a small fortune lobbying congress to drop restrictions on #ZTE & it worked. Long term China is a bigger threat to America’s security than Russia, when are we going to take it seriously? … Any dismantling by #NorthKorea is good. But we should be careful not to get too giddy about this one. This is largely symbolic & does little to degrade their dangerous & growing ICBM capability which relies on different sites & different technology. … Who is a God like you, who removes guilt & pardons sin for the remnant of his inheritance; Who does not persist in anger forever, but instead delights in mercy. Micah 7:18 Threats against the U.S. from #Iran are evidence of a government facing very serious internal pressure. A severe fuel shortage with no easy solution combined with imminent sanctions after terrible #IranDeal was cancelled pose a real threat to the regime. … Working with #Russia to deny #ISIS territory to hold in #Syria would be ideal. But it won’t happen because #Putin insists on 3 pre-conditions: - A Syria controlled by Pro-Russia regime - military bases for Russia; and - exclusive access to oil & gas fields … No nation steals from or spies on us more than #China & they use telecomm companies like #ZTE to do it. That’s why I fought so hard to put ZTE out of business in the U.S. & why its shocking some decided to cave & let them survive. We got played by China again. This can’t continue The Ortega/Murillo regime in #Nicaragua has in essence declared war on the church & it’s clergy. Lost in all the coverage of other issues is this rapidly escalating crisis in our hemisphere which has direct implications on our national security & interests … I believe the Russians will try to undermine our elections again and I strongly urge every election official to use the resources available to them to prevent it from happening.pic.twitter.com/Az4JmPAemp You have been told, O mortal, what is good, and what the LORD requires of you: Only to do justice and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your God. Micah 6:8 The @FBI had many reasons to look into this guy. And looking into him is not “spying” on Trump campaign, because as the White House made clear last year, he was “not an ‘advisor’ to Mr. Trump in any sense of the word.” … I believe #Putin wants to weaken America. Unfortunately he retains a significant % of the worlds nuclear weapons. Therefore, we have no choice but to engage with him,while also confronting him on his aggression & wrongdoing. … Will be on live at 9am Eastern Time with @jaketapper @CNNSotu #CNNSOTU … Just did interview with @FaceTheNation @CBSNews  to discuss #Helsinki, #Putin meeting in D.C. & #DETERAct … When he disembarked and saw the vast crowd, his heart was moved with pity for them, for they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.  Mark 6:34 For years we allowed #China to get away with economic aggression. Confronting them is 100% right thing to do. My only difference with Trump admin on this is that instead of fighting  EU,Japan,Mexico & Canada we should have teamed up with them to do this … After Ortega/Murillo reign of terror their is no future for them in power. Strong U.S. reaction is coming. They will pay big price for their crimes against their own people. I strongly advise #Nicaragua military not to participate in oppressing the people. … the mount of the LORD’s house shall be established as the highest mountain;...& Many nations shall come & say “Come, let us climb the LORD’s mountain to the house of the God of Jacob,That he may instruct us in his ways, that we may walk in his paths” Micah 4:1-2 It’s not schools fault that an accused #Russia spy spoke at @USouthFlorida St. Petersburg world affairs conference. If she had told them who she really was & what she was up to she wouldn’t be a spy. Concealing their intentions is what spies literally do. … I gave a speech about this yesterday at @Heritage. Read about concerns that “deep fake” technology will be utilized to blackmail U.S. troops with phony audio & video. Need to pay more attention to this now before it happens not wait to react after it does: … Xi Jinping has no “intention of following through” on discussions held this year between the two countries & has “not responded at all” to U.S. demands to stop stealing American trade secrets. So lets allow #ZTE to stay in business and keep stealing??????? … Arguing we shouldn’t ban #ZTE because then all the business will go to another #China spy company #Huawei isn’t a  reason to let ZTE stay,its a reason to go after Huawei as well. But if we aren’t willing to take on #ZTE we will never take on a much larger company like Huawei. The #ZTECave endangers passage of an important & good bill & every argument for caving is weak. A sanctions compliance official on the board won’t stop backdoor access to routers. A big fine is small price to pay compared to value of info they will steal. … Given the specific details many of my Senate colleagues know about #ZTE & how #China intends to use them against the U.S.,  I am surprised they caved so easily in conference. Our bipartisan #DETERAct with @ChrisVanHollen -which would automatically impose crippling sanctions on #Russia if #Putin interferes in our elections again- is gaining momentum. We added another 4 Democrat & 4 GOP cosponsors yesterday. More on the way.  This is textbook example of #Putin playing “Divide & Conquer.” Yesterday he alluded to“useful agreements” reached in #Helsinki & that now U.S. jobs & European & Middle Eastern security hang in the balance if U.S. opponents try to block these “agreements.” … Every valley shall be lifted up, every mountain and hill made low; The rugged land shall be a plain, the rough country, a broad valley. Then the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken  Isaiah 40: 4-5 This deal on #CFIUS is good news. The bad news? They had to cave on #ZTE in order to get it. So chances that a #China controlled telecomm will not just stay in business, but do so here inside the U.S. sadly just went up. #BadTradeoff … Today I spoke @Heritage about how foreign adversary such as #Putin #Russia could further weaponize information against us, using #DeepFakes to threaten our democracy & national security. Watch Here:  Why does @CommerceGov allow #ZTE stay in business? Why would some on conference committee cave on ZTE & settle for CFIUS reform only? ZTE is part of broader pattern of sanctions violations & illicit deals by firms with ties to #China’s military. … While is & remains a very serious threat. But #China is even more of a danger. They are quietly building an army of influence agents in the U.S. by turning Americans against our countries interests & in favor of China’s.   … via @thedailybeast The Ortega/Murillo human rights abuses,murders & kidnappings continue in #Nicaragua. Now real consequences must follow. I will be pushing for Global Magnitsky sanctions on those responsible & direct financial sanctions against any military leader who participates in these crimes. Reminder of what I said almost 4 months ago. #Florida is a VERY attractive target for election chaos effort. Not because officials are doing something wrong but because of our importance in national politics. We need to take this very seriously.  … #sayfie … Under no circumstances should #Putin officials ever be allowed to come into the U.S. & “question” Americans on their list. I don’t believe this will ever be allowed to happen which is why the ⁦@WhiteHouse⁩ should publicly & unequivocally rule it out. … Excellent investigative reporting on how dirty $ flows through real estate using shell companies.  … I have proposed a bipartisan law to prevent individuals from using anonymous shell corporations to engage in illicit activities. … While we let #ZTE stay in business even as they break our laws & spy on us, this is the kind of hardball #China plays. They have forced an airline to close down because the companies home country has diplomatic ties with #Taiwan  #China is aggressively targeting & threatening American companies with punishment unless they agree to pretend that #Taiwan doesn’t exist. The issues with #Russia are very bad. But the long-term threats from China are ten times worse. … In 2016 #Huawei directed two employees to deceive their way into an annual “TIP Summit” held at @Facebook HQ for startups competing against Huawei. Those employees then sent trade secrets back to #China.  The wicked, when spared, do not learn justice; in an upright land they act perversely & do not see the majesty of the LORD. LORD, your hand is raised high,but they do not perceive it; Let them be put to shame when they see your zeal for your people. Isaiah: 26:10-11 Overall a good day for #DETERAct. Some challenges emerged but support is growing. We have to get this done because the only way to even have a chance at keeping #Putin from interfering in our future elections is to make the price of hostilities higher than the benefit from it. Also spoke on @AmericaNewsroom  about why abolishing @ICEgov is a stupid, radical & irresponsible idea. ICE enforces immigration law,they don’t make it. And they do more than just immigration,they go after traffickers & gangs who are in the country illegally. … Was on @AmericaNewsroom this morning talking about our #DETERAct & the need to make sure #Putin understands we will not overlook his hostilities & he will face punishing consequences if he does it again. … Last night #Alabama #GOP made a great choice by electing a great conservative & my friend @WillAinsworthAL as their nominee for Lieutenant Governor. Now its on to victory in November! … Making sure that the benefits of our booming economy reaches the American worker must become one of the primary goals of our domestic agenda. And it’s not just about money. America can’t truly be strong if we don’t restore & protect the dignity of work. … Requiring ⁦@SecretService⁩ or other agency to protect presidential candidates digitally in addition to physically is very interesting idea. Will be looking into this asap. Makes sense given what we know about 2016 & what we expect in the future. … Let Mueller continue & finish his probe & we on Senate Intel are on track to finish ours. But the most meaningful measure we can take is to pass bipartisan #DETERAct which imposes specific & serious sanctions if #Putin interferes in our elections again. … I know for a fact #Putin interfered in 2016 & we should punish it. But while we can’t change the past we can influence the future. So let’s pass the #DeterAct to try & prevent Putin interference in 2018 & beyond. The spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him: a spirit of wisdom and of understanding, A spirit of counsel and of strength, a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the LORD, and his delight shall be the fear of the LORD. Isaiah 11:2-3 Nueva ola de ataques por parte de las pandillas paramilitares de #OrtegaMurillo en #Monimbo #Masaya. Ahora vienen las consecuencias para Ortega y Murillo por esta delincuencia. #SOSNicaragua Images from earlier this morning of what sources inside #Nicaragua describe as blue shirted #OrtegaMurillo paramilitary gang preparing to attack.pic.twitter.com/GZUAl6HSbw At this moment the parish church of Mary Magdalene in #Monimbó #Nicaragua is being targeted by #OrtegaMurillo paramilitary gang. At least one priest is trapped inside. Receiving reports from inside #Nicaragua of a new wave of violent attacks by #OrtegaMurillo paramilitary gangs in  #Monimbo #Masaya. The situation is rapidly deteriorating. #Helsinki & subsequent reaction showed #Putin achieved goals of interference: 1. Weaken next President with nagging & persistent allegations; 2. Weaken public confidence in our political parties,media & govt agencies; & 3. Weaken U.S. by inflaming partisan & cultural divisions Scoundrels, villains, are they who deal in crooked talk. Shifty of eye,feet ever moving,pointing with fingers,They have perversity in their hearts,always plotting evil,sowing discord. Therefore their doom comes suddenly;in an instant they are crushed beyond cure. Proverbs 6:12-19 #Putin’s interference in 2016 didn’t elect Trump & it doesn’t mean we don’t deal with him on other issues. But we can’t afford to forget he always exploits weakness. If we don’t acknowledge & punish what he did,his next attack on us will be bolder,more brazen & far more damaging. Foreign policy must be based on reality,not hyperbole or wishful thinking. And the reality is #Russia is an adversary. Because #Putin doesn’t believe in win/win scenarios & thinks only way to make Russia stronger is to make U.S. weaker. Any approach not based on this will fail. Been making this point for 5 years now. Economic growth doesn’t distribute through economy the way it once did. The rising tide of a booming economy doesn’t necessarily lift all ships anymore. Why I pushed for #ChildTaxCredit & now #PaidFamilyLeave … Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth, for the LORD speaks: Sons have I raised and reared, but they have rebelled against me! Isaiah 1:2 Inside the church where Nicaraguan paramilitaries laid siege on university students … I will listen for what God, the LORD, has to say; surely he will speak of peace to his people and to his faithful. May they not turn to foolishness! Psalms 85:9 Several wks ago I personally told #Nicaragua F.M. Denis Moncada Colindres that opportunity still existed to avoid cycle of conflict with U.S. if they held early & fair elections. But Ortega/Murillo regime responded with more violence making very clear the path they have chosen Watch LIVE the developing situation in #Nicaragua via 100 NOTICIAS NICARAGUA   via @YouTube We are awaiting the promised release of the students, journalists & clergy trapped inside church by armed Ortega gang. We know of at least one fatality inside. These are the bullets these Ortega paramilitary criminal gangs are using & this is the consequence. An unarmed student shot in the head overnight, taken into church by fellow students who could not ambulances in to rescue him, & he died this morning. 4/4pic.twitter.com/0PS0E0pBgU This ongoing attack & siege is being conducted by paramilitary gangs which are armed & controlled by Ortega & his wife/VP Rosario Murillo. They will be held directly & personally responsible for those who have already died or been wounded & any others who die or are wounded. 3/4pic.twitter.com/z0u35b7WHU Outside church & Non-Govt leaders are pleading & praying to be allowed access to tend to the injured & release those trapped inside. But apparently Ortega government intends to kill those students & journalists remaining. 2/4pic.twitter.com/bqttWrhpkx Ortega paramilitary gangs continue to fire on Divine Mercy Church in #Nicaragua where journalist, student & clergy remain trapped. Ambulances are outside ready to assist but Ortega gangs will not allow them in.  1/4pic.twitter.com/2s7S24q4Ld Those who are wise in their own eyes,prudent in their own view!.. who acquit the guilty for bribes & deprive the innocent of justice!..their root shall rot..;..For they have rejected the instruction of the LORD of hosts & scorned the word of the Holy One of Israel. Is 5:21,23-24 When these “Opportunity Zone” projects end up transforming long forgotten communities across America their will be one person who will deserve most of the credit for making this possible & that is ⁦@SenatorTimScott⁩ … Ambulances must be allowed to enter church immediately & remove the wounded before someone loses their life. If anyone dies because of this deliberate delay by the regime,Ortega & his wife will be held personally responsible. The ambulances are outside building,let them in now … Despite my frequent disagreement with the way some in media cover our politics,tonight we got a powerful reminder of why press freedom is worth protecting. @partlowj from @WaPo was interviewing student protestors in #Nicaragua when Ortega regime attacked university. … After their paramilitary gang attacked church & natl univ #UNAN tonight the Ortega regime must immediately end the attack,allow the injured to be taken to hospital, release U.S. journalist @partlowj immediately from & allow everyone else to leave as soon as possible #Nicaragua Divine Mercy parish church in #Nicaragua under attack by Ortega paramilitary gang. Serious injuries but Ortega not allowing medical personnel to enter. This is part of coordinated simultaneous attacks tonight by these gangs in several places including the National Univ #UNAN … Continuing to confirm other reports receiving tonight from inside #Nicaragua. In addition, independent media outlets have been forced off the air & only government version of events is being broadcast inside country right now. … Also the neighborhood where many U.S. embassy employees live is under attack. That is not a coincidence. Ortega, his wife (who is also the VP of #Nicaragua) & those empowering him will be held directly responsible if any hard should come to any U.S. personnel or their families U.S. journalist for @WAPO @partlowj is trapped inside a church under siege by Ortega thugs. Reports serious injuries but Ortega forces not allowing ambulances to enter & render aid. … At this moment Ortega thugs are setting fire to #UNAN the national university of #Nicaragua trying to either smoke out student protestors or be burned alive. Have been informed a Jesuit priest & a U.S. journalist from a major outlet are among those trapped inside. A few hours ago Ortega ordered Paramilitary gangs & security forces to attack #UNAN students & a catholic church. Reports & video coming in of severe injuries & fatalities. Also reports that several non-regime controlled media outlets have been taken off the air. #NicaraguaSOS … Situation tonight in #Nicaragua is rapidly & dangerously escalating. Ortega & those in his govt are on notice that if any harm comes to U.S. personnel or their families he will personally face severe repercussions & if his violence leads to a bloodbath he will face consequences 3rd, #Putin will do this again & it will be even more difficult to stop. Changing voter registration data,strategically timed deep fakes, targeting congressional enemies & races with outsized national influence, these are just some of the things we could see in 2018 or 2020. 4/4 Second,the most influential yet unwitting collaborators of the Putin effort was the media which extensively covered every salicious detail of the leaks, but spent little time looking into who was behind the hacking & their motivation. 3/4 While Putin may have developed a preference for Trump that wasn’t his primary objective & that isn’t why he won. His goal was to exacerbate our political divisions & get us to fight each other even more. Something we already do a pretty good job of ourselves without his help 2/4 I dont “believe” Putin interfered in our elections I know for a fact he did. But some important nuances are being completely ignored in the analysis, coverage & partisan reaction to todays indictments. 1/4 #Florida’s #EmeraldCoast is our once “well kept secret” that isn’t so secret anymore. The proof is the growing number of 30A stickers I am seeing in the most unexpected of places. The word is out about #NWFlorida … Just attended an event in #Hialeah #Florida where @FLGovScott laid out a strong agenda on behalf of the cause of a free #Cuba. Very well received,especially by a crowd filled with people whose loved ones were murdered by the Castro regime. #Sayfie #China really knows how to play & extort American multinational corporations. @Apple which is desperate to stay in business in China agrees to invest another $300 million in its Chinese suppliers   “Clean Energy” fund. … Translation: Good news, paychecks have increased. Bad news, prices have gone up by even more. Prices growing faster than wages is great for profits. But very bad for working families. We need to do more for American workers. #PaidFamilyLeave would help. … Current unlawful immigration surge different than previous ones. Being driven from #NorthernTriangle not #Mexico & they are fleeing violence & crime not searching for $. Best way to fix this long term is helping these countries reduce violence & crime … Spoke about this yesterday.   #Putin does not seek “better relations” with U.S. he seeks an equality with U.S. he believes is only possible if America grows weaker & Russia stronger. For him our relationship is a competition that can only have one winner 5/5 Nearly impossible to truly “partner” with #Putin because he views geopolitics as zero sum competition & the world as place where the strong prey on the weak. That’s why he seeks to make Russia a great power equal to U.S. & why his true interest is gaining an advantage.  4/5 #Putin is always looking to exploit what he perceives as vulnerabilities of foreign counterparts. He will weaponize their personal information while carefully guarding his own. He will try to make counterparts appear anxious or indecisive & himself as unemotional & in control 3/5 #Putin views & personality formed growing up in the Soviet society. No leader can have a good relationship with him because he trusts no one. And partnering with him is difficult because he views geopolitics as a zero-sum competition in which the strong prey on the weak. 2/5 No one has been a harsher critic of #Putin than I have been. No one. But with 90% of the worlds nukes controlled by #Russia & U.S. we have no choice but to meet with him. That said, we should clearly know who Putin is & what he wants. 1/5  … via @WSJOpinion From early days after storm I said federal response in #PuertoRico was inadequate,not b/c of bad faith or lack of interest but b/c @fema⁩ system was not set up for storm like this,in territory off mainland & already facing preexisting challenges … When they hand you over,do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say. You will be given at that moment what you are to say. For it will not be you who speak but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Mt 10:19-20 Excited to endorse @RossSpano in the Florida 15th. He is a rock solid Conservative. He will be an asset to the Conservative movement in DC and will tirelessly represent Hillsborough, Polk & Lake Counties. #FL15  I urge all Floridians to vote for @mattcaldwell_fl for Commissioner of Agriculture this August and November. … China just keeps stealing. An Ex-Apple engineer was arrested at San Jose International Airport while preparing to board a flight to #China & charged with stealing proprietary information related to @Apple  self-driving car project. … Very good piece by @IvankaTrump. I know other ideas & plans are being offered, but we are working with her & many others on a creating an option for #PaidFamilyLeave that has a chance of actually becoming law. … Read this opinion piece on #FoxNews: “I'm a proud conservative and I believe we need paid family leave”  How exactly do you conduct a study on a #PaidFamilyLeave proposal that hasn’t even been introduced yet? Having the details of the plan would be useful, no? … The #LakeOkeechobee reservoir project was approved by White House yesterday. Now we need to get it authorized by Congress. Not done yet but getting to this point in less than 2 yrs is unprecedented. But this project will make a difference for #Florida … This tweet made my day! A reminder that children are a blessing from God. … We had a long & productive meeting yesterday at @WhiteHouse to discuss details of #PaidFamilyLeave. A few items left to tighten up but we are very close to having a bill we hope can garner widespread support. … But you have plowed wickedness, reaped perversity,and eaten the fruit of falsehood. Because you have trusted in your own power,and in your many warriors, the clamor of war shall break out among your people and all your fortresses shall be ravaged. Hosea 10:13-14 Another example of why we would be better off working with our allies to focus on unfair trade practices by #China instead of getting into a trade dispute with our allies. Deal with China first,then we can fix our imbalances with others. … They made kings, but not by my authority; they established princes, but without my knowledge. With their silver and gold they made idols for themselves,to their own destruction. Hosea 8:4 Continuing to work today on getting OMB to sign off on the expedited water-storage reservoir south of #LakeOkeechobee. Long term this would help make a difference for health of #IndianRiverLagoon #SaintLucieRiver & #EvergladesRestoration #sayfie Will have to work hard this week to lay out facts about #PaidFamilyLeave plan. Fact #1,it’s OPTIONAL,no one is required to take it. Fact #2,no one is taking your #SocialSecurity. It’s your $ & this is just an option to take some of it early for paid leave. … Thank you @potus @whitehouse for intervening to get  @JaxStrong to issue short term suspension of #LakeOkeechobee discharge. Now need to work on long term solution including reevaluating discharge process & fully funding expedited reservoir project  … #Sayfie In all the communities which the LORD, your God, is giving you, you shall appoint judges & officials throughout your tribes to administer true justice for the people. Deuteronomy 16:18 I have been talking to White House today asking that @POTUS order the @USACEHQ to conduct emergency re-evaluation of water flows from #LakeOkeechobee currently entering the #CaloosahatcheeRiver & delay tomorrows scheduled discharges to #StLucieRiver #Sayfie I will rather boast most gladly of my weaknesses in order that the power of Christ may dwell with me. Therefore, I am content with weaknesses,insults, hardships,persecutions & constraints for the sake of Christ;for when I am weak,then I am strong. 2 Cor 12:9-10 I will restore my people Israel, they shall rebuild & inhabit their ruined cities,Plant vineyards & drink the wine,set out gardens & eat the fruits. I will plant them upon their own ground;never again shall they be plucked From the land I have given them.  Amos 9:14-15 Expedited  #HerbertHooverDike work important,but alone won’t solve #algaebloom threat to #SaintLucieRiver &  #IndianRiverLagoon. Need clean #KissimmeeRiver,reduced #LakeOkeechobee discharges & finish projects to restore clean H2O release into #Everglades  Long Term Disaster Recovery Investment Plan we worked on is great news for #Florida. Full fed funding for expedited #HerbertHooverDike project,beach renourishment & our S. Atlantic Coastal Study & will help with flood protection & storm resilience #Sayfie … .@thedartmouth  ICYMI Several months ago I tweeted about how I had changed my view on philosophy & the reason why. We need welders AND philosophers.  … … The decline in U.S. birthdate is complicated & driven by many factors. But we must do more to help families raising children with the rising cost of child care & with #PaidFamilyLeave. … Calling out @NATO allies for not spending enough is not new. For 70 yrs almost every previous administration did the same. What is new is questioning the value of the alliance. The end of #NATO would be a dream come true for #Putin.  … #axiosam Let me answer my taunters with a word,for I trust in your word. Do not take the word of truth from my mouth,for in your judgments is my hope. I will speak openly of your testimonies without fear even before kings. Psalms:119:42-43;46 Our politics is making once reasonable people unreasonable & unstable people dangerous. Turning neighbors into strangers & friends into enemies. Yet voices on both sides keep feeding it b/c it’s good for ratings,fundraising & 15 minutes of fame. … The controversies surrounding the former administrator of @EPA had become a major impediment & necessitated a leadership change. I am hopeful that under new leadership the agency will be in a better position to carry out the important work of protecting our natural environment. The most important investment we can make is in our children & their parents. That’s why I pushed hard to successfully double the #ChildTaxCredit. And next week we will introduce a new bill to provide paid family leave in a fiscally-responsible way.  Today the U.S. will sanction additional members of the Ortega government in #Nicaragua. Time is running out for Ortega to address the current crisis by holding early, free & fair elections. Will be proposing a new law to stop the #FloridaShuffle. Rogue companies are driving a Sober Home crisis by getting a kickback for every patient they refer to rehab. Many don’t receive services creating the rise of a lucrative “perpetual rehab” industry … Instead of tariff fight it would be better to first work together with #Canada #Mexico #Japan & #EU to confront our common challenge, #China unfair trade practices & intellectual property theft. Our trade issues with allies need to be addressed,but we should first focus on China Later today @JaxStrong will be announcing the “Long Term Disaster Recovery Investment Program.” It was funded by disaster recovery bill earlier this year & will have good news for #Florida projects & studies including #EvergladesRestoration & #LakeOkeechobee #Sayfie Hard to be happy about anything regarding #LakeOkeechobee when 90% is now covered by #AlgaeBloom  & discharges are set to begin again Monday. However later today expect very good news on our efforts to get full funding for federal share of Herbert Hoover Dike repairs #Sayfie It’s hard to balance our laws & our values (as the nasty comments which will soon follow will no doubt prove). But we must do it. Because open borders is wrong. And so is dehumanizing people, the vast majority of whom are fleeing threats to their families from gangs & violence Our sovereignty requires us to secure our borders,enforce the law & discourage illegal migration. Our Judeo-Christian values command us to treat those unlawfully here as children of God, worthy of compassion & of our respect for their God given dignity … Our tech firms reject U.S. military,but embrace Tsinghua which supplies tech to #China’s military. @HEWLETTPACKARD sold them their China-based server, @intel invested $1.5 billion, @Dell has strategic partnership & @IBM allows them to license advanced tech  Example of hypocrisy of many U.S. tech companies. Refuse to work with U.S. military on #ProjectMaven but work with partners tied to China military. For example @Google's @Jeffdean serves as #AI advisor for univ tied to key tech supplier to China's military  It’s a very simple question,should #ZTE a company subsidized & ultimately controlled by #China govt & which poses a natl security threat to U.S. be shut down by denying them access to American high-tech or should they pay a big fine & stay in business? … My decision on whether to support @potus #SCOTUSnominee will be based on one primary factor,do they understand that because #SCOTUS is a “trier of law” appellate court & not a “trier of fact” trial court,their job will be to apply the law,not make new ones … Got involved in this fight against ⁦@US_FDA⁩ 2 years ago. Reading this story made my day. Won’t get much attention in news culture dominated by outrage,but for families facing #Duchenne muscular dystrophy it’s a matter of life or death. … Cleanse me from my inadvertent sins. Also from arrogant ones restrain your servant;let them never control me. Then shall I be blameless,innocent of grave sin. Let the words of my mouth be acceptable,the thoughts of my heart before you,LORD, my rock & my redeemer. Psalms 19:13-15 Our goal is not to make #MadeinChina2025 fail. Our goal is & must remain a U.S. & #China relationship that is balanced & a competition that is fair instead of one China wins as a result of cheating & theft of our intellectual property. … In many ways America is stronger than ever. But our shared national identity is in trouble. The erosion of non-political ties to one another has increasingly left us with politics as the primary source of our individual identity & as the primary influence in how we view others. Be free, yet without using freedom as a pretext for evil, but as slaves of God.  1 Peter 2:16 2/2: "that government is only a convenience created and managed by the people, with no powers of its own except those voluntarily granted to it by the people. We sometimes forget that great truth, and we never should. Happy Fourth of July.” — Pres. Ronald Reagan #IndependenceDaypic.twitter.com/X6lZofFKw1 1/2: “Let the Fourth of July always be a reminder that here in this land, for the first time, it was decided that man is born with certain God-given rights… While all the focus has been on changing voting results, there is more than one way to hack an election. This is an ongoing threat we need to take very seriously: … It is important that EVERY county election department in #Florida take advantage of the resources @DHSgov provides. The threat posed by foreign intelligence operatives is significant. … Agree with this decision 100%. It would be grossly irresponsible to allow #ChinaMobile to operate in the U.S. market. Like every #China telecommunication company, they pose a grave security risk.  Stay tuned. Good news coming soon on #PaidFamilyLeave … Praise the LORD, all you nations! Extol him, all you peoples! His mercy for us is strong; the faithfulness of the LORD is forever. Hallelujah! Psalms 117:1-2 It’s only a matter of time before foreign intelligence agencies use high-tech deception of 'deepfake' videos to try & undermine our democracy,influence our elections & further divide our society. I’ve been warning about this for some time. Read more here: … You hate discipline;you cast my words behind you! If you see a thief,you run with him;with adulterers you throw in your lot. You give your mouth free rein for evil;you yoke your tongue to deceit. You sit & speak against your brother,slandering your mother’s son. Psalms 50: 17-20 ..we commend ourselves as ministers of God, through much endurance,in afflictions, hardships, constraints, beatings, imprisonments, riots,labors,vigils,fasts;by purity,knowledge,patience,kindness,in a holy spirit,in unfeigned love,in truthful speech,in the power of God; 2 Cor:4-8 More Americans have been evacuated from #China after abnormal sounds & sensations, like the ones which led to previous injuries in Cuba & China, were reported. … The LORD is my strength and my shield, in whom my heart trusts. I am helped, so my heart rejoices; with my song I praise him. Psalms 28:7 So this is the great deal we have on #ZTE? They replace board members with new directors hand­picked by the controlling shareholder who in turn is backed & controlled by the #China government. Why are we allowing them to continue to play us like this? … These are the three things we need to do if we’re serious about bringing the immigration issue under control.pic.twitter.com/aDTy3jPkjb It’s fine for @POTUS to meet with #Putin. U.S. & Russia possess largest nuclear arsenals in world. But would be a grave mistake to downplay the fact that Putin is an accomplice to war crimes,interfered in our elections & assasinates his political opponents. #DontTrustAlwaysVerify Too often we look to D.C. for the answers. But here is a reminder that most of the important innovations we need to bring about a #NewAmericanCentury,like closing the #SkillsGap, will come from the state & local level in partnership with private sector … Claim that departure of @IvankaTrump staffer signals “a likely pullback” from efforts to pass a paid family leave bill  is 100% false. We have made real progress over the last 4 months. Will have more news on this very soon. Stay Tuned.  Thank you to ⁦@united⁩ ⁦@AmericanAir⁩ & ⁦@Delta⁩ for continuing to refuse #China unreasonable demands. Stay strong. … #Putin would not be doing us a favor helping curb #Iran military in #Syria. It’s in his interest as well. But know this, if forced to pick between Iran & Russia, Assad will pick Iran & Hezbollah every time. … Should never forget that #KJU is a sadist with political prison camps & who engages in abductions,torture,forced starvation & sexual violence against women. This week we passed my #NorthKorea Human Rights bill. I urge ⁦@POTUS⁩ to sign it asap. … Sign of our times... the F word is now routinely used in news stories, tweets etc It’s not even F*** anymore.  Who made that decision??? This is a vanity that occurs on earth: There are those who are just but are treated as though they had done evil, and those who are wicked but are treated as though they had done justly. Ecclesiastes 8:14 #Putin has influence campaign is to divide us,but #China has an even broader one to create domestic pressure on U.S. policymakers to support China’s agenda. Today we introduced a bipartisan bill that would reveal to the public how vast that operation is. … In attacking me #Huawei exec said it “takes decades” to turn research into something marketable. The problem is #China steals our decades of research! Also said “everybody” benefits from research. Problem is #China blocks everyone else from their market! … With all the fighting going on in America, the one thing I think has bipartisan support is the fact that we have to confront China.pic.twitter.com/qfs1ABmjMU It’s not good that people increasingly get news & information only from sources that confirm what they want to hear. It’s terrible that their is increasingly no space for nuance or 3rd way on any issue. If media doesn’t think they have contributed to this they are very mistaken. BTW I’m not happy about this reality. It’s terrible for country. Lack of trust in reporting leaves us vulnerable to conspiracy theories & unable to have debates  b/c we can’t even agree on baseline facts. We are all ALL to blame for this mess. Sorry, that includes many in media … Of course #Putin continues to deny interfering in our elections. But he did. That is not a matter of opinion, it is an indisputable FACT. McCain is hero & patriot. But in 2008 “journalists” who now extol his virtues portrayed him as a madman & the @nytimes smeared him the day after he sealed GOP nomination. Romney behaved with respect & dignity. But in 2012 media savaged him & portrayed him as a misogynist #BIAS Re-upping this tweet from 2 days ago. GOP voters defend Trump when attacked by media,OFTEN DESPITE NOT LIKING WHAT HE DID OR SAID,because they view media as unfair & biased. And generally,elected Republicans & elected Democrats for that matter don’t like being crossways with base … .@AxiosAm : “The MEDIA,normally the LAST CHECK on a president with total control of government,HAS LOST THE TRUST OF MOST REPUBLICANS & many Democrats,after two years of Trump pummeling”. They don’t join you in attacking Trump b/c they don’t believe you. … Some very good suggestions in this column about how to deal with #China. I filed a bill two months ago that offers very similar proposals. … As expected,the reaction of the “usual suspects” to this tweet yesterday either proved my point or missed it.  Many in the media & Trump bashers are not self aware enough to realize how biased & dishonest a very large % of GOP voters & officeholders view them & the impact it has … A roaring lion or a ravenous bear is a wicked ruler over a poor people. Proverbs 28:15 Read this account of an outrageous theft by #China of an American companies chip design. They do this every day & all the time. This is why it is so important that President Trump not back off his plan to prevent Chinese takeovers of U.S. tech firms. … I admire Justice Kennedy's frequent calls for greater civility in our discourse. Now I look forward to a fair & thorough confirmation process THIS FALL of an individual who will respect the principles of original intent & judicial restraint #SCOTUS It is a mistake to pretend the migration & trade fights we are debating in U.S. are unique to us. Europe is having many of the same fights right now. The leading issue threatening to oust Merkel in #Germany is migration & border. Ditto Italy, Austria etc. … Head of #Huawei attacked me for wanting restrictions on their research with our universities. They’ve made fortune through theft,unfair practices & spying for #China. Can’t blame him for being mad that U.S. finally catching on to their profitable tricks … I have decided to block the addition of any new amendments to #FarmBill until they either accept the Cruz amendment striking the use of taxpayer $ for promotions in #Cuba or they accept my amendment that prohibits taxpayer $ being spent at business owned by Cuban military Stronger CFIUS good for stopping bad deals. But some technologies critical to national security should NEVER be sold to or shared with #China. That’s why these promised restrictions are so important & why backing off on them would be so disappointing … While we spend our time fighting each other a China-centric technology future is taking shape. If we don’t wake up & get moving #China will be setting global standards for AI, gene editing ethics, 5G, & controlling global data flows & digital commerce. … Many Republicans won’t criticize Trump even when they don’t agree with him b/c it means siding with a media that nevers cuts him a break,turns even little things he does into an act of evil,are also unfair to them & in the end will still attack you anyway … A Chinese national who lives in Massachusetts as a green card permanent resident was charged with stealing U.S. anti-submarine warfare devices for #China under orders of the Chinese military research institute named Northwestern Polytechnical University … #China has ordered trade & news outlets to not mention #MadeinChina2025 which is their industrial “master plan” to become the worlds leading high tech superpower by any means necessary,including the theft & forced transfer of intellectual property … Amazing story about a man in #PuertoRico created a solar-powered generator for families without power … I am filing a new bill that will ban #China companies from receiving taxpayer funded small business loans from the @SBAgov … If in fact President Trump is now backtracking on tough limits on Chinese investment, it is a VERY BIG MISTAKE. #China is strategically buying up U.S. companies specializing in cutting edge technology. What they don’t steal from us they buy away from us … Consider the work of God. Who can make straight what God has made crooked? Ecclesiastes 7:13 Congratulations to my friend William Timmons on earning the GOP nomination in #SC04 tonight. On to the general election in November! @votetimmons Recurring nightmare of Algae bloom from Lake O is back. Yesterday I passed an amendment in spending bill that requires @USACEHQ to control releases. But the ultimate solution is finishing Central Everglades Planning Project so clean water can flow south. … South Carolina is voting today - I encourage you to support William Timmons in his runoff election. @votetimmons. #sc04 100% correct: “Individuals emerge out of families, communities,faiths,neighborhoods & nations” not the other way around. What happens when those things break down? You look for a sense of belonging in a political tribe & your politics becomes your identity … We are ALL fiddling during this fire! While we fight with each other,try to out nasty each other & harass each other out of restaurants & movie theaters #China is playing hardball around the world using unfair loans & aid to gain influence at our expense … 44 yr old migrant says“I’m not leaving my country because I want to”. She once owned restaurant but gang demanded $5k she couldn’t pay. Then 2 of her sons disappeared & her husband was killed. As long as that continues we will have a crisis on our border. … Immigration issue is hard b/c our sovereignty requires us to have borders. Our history requires us to remember we are all immigrants. Our constitution requires due process. And our Judeo-Christian values requires us to show compassion. No other nation has to balance all that! When you have migrants saying “I’d rather be in jail in the U.S. than killed in my own country” it is clear the most effective measure we can take to stop border crisis is to help El Salvador,Honduras & Guatemala deal with crime & poverty driving migration … #ZTE & #Huawei equipment provides #China access to U.S. data flowing through networks. And they also use billions of $ of #China govt subsidies/credit to push U.S. companies out of markets & help China develop the global 5G standard before the U.S. does.  Fear of others becomes a snare, but the one who trusts in the LORD is safe. Proverbs 29:25 Spoke to Sheriff Smith of Franklin County,Florida. 30 to 40 mobile homes destroyed by terrible fire leaving 200 hardworking Americans homeless. Working to see if any Federal assistance is available. But if you can, please donate to help them out: … After Xi threatened “American” multinational companies saying #China will give preferen­tial treat­ment to com­pa­nies whose coun­tries aren’t standing up to China, you watch how many of these CEO’s descend on D.C. to back China & attack U.S. policy. … #China President Xi told a group of CEO’s from U.S. that “In the West you have the no­tion that if somebody hits you on the left cheek, you turn the other cheek”. I wonder if he knows that “notion” actually came from a 1st century Jew from the Middle East? … Actually, the press got to tour the Homestead facility before either one of us at 10am Friday. DHS offered members of congress a choice between two seperate times to visit Homestead facility, 1pm Friday & 1pm Saturday. I picked Friday. … Liberal harassment of Trump aides & GOP officials will galvanize #GOP base in Nov,but it’s terrible for America. Only matter of time before other side responds in kind. At this rate Putin doesn’t really need to worry too much anymore about sowing division … Wonder if ⁦after @EU_Commission⁩ hit 11 more cronies of #Venezuela dictator @NicolasMaduro⁩ with sanctions,he & those around him have finally figured out that fake election on May 20 only made things worse for them? Real democracy is only way out! … I’m not only one who realizes that many Republicans who don’t agree with everything Trump does are moved to support him because they feel he is often unfairly attacked. The @NYT in an insightful report yesterday by @jwpetersNYT said the exact same thing  Politics on both sides so tribal it reaches dining,entertainment & sports & where being nasty to those on other side is a sign of commitment to your “political tribe” isn’t far removed from irrational gang rivalries driven by what neighborhood you live in or what  colors you wear These incidents of harassing Republicans during private time weren’t organic actions of an outraged public. They were largely the actions of activists. But the other side has activists too. What happens when they start doing this to Democrats? #NotGood … Trump haters still haven’t realized how much they help him with their condescension of those who either voted for him or don’t share their hatred of him. And how much they help him with their irrational hostility towards those who work for him. I filed bill 2 months ago that does what Trump administration plans to do later this week by executive order,ban #China from investing in U.S. technology firms or exporting technology to China. This is not a trade matter, its a national security imperative … This is happening. Whether we like it or not the age of automation is well underway. But most policy makers do not realize it,much less begun to think about it. This will create both disruptions & opportunities. … You rocked the earth, split it open; repair the cracks for it totters. You made your people go through hardship, made us stagger from the wine you gave us. Raise up a banner for those who revere you,a refuge for them out of bow shot. Psalms 60:4-6 LORD,you have probed me,you know me: you know when I sit & stand;you understand my thoughts from afar. You sift through my travels & my rest;with all my ways you are familiar. Even before a word is on my tongue,LORD, you know it all. Psalms 139: 1-4 Actually more like 2 screaming people who apparently support a release policy that encourges already vulnerable migrants to bring children with them on dangerous journey to unlawfully cross U.S. border. Great policy for human traffickers & cartels, but not so great for children. … Won’t be easy to house families together,but we must do it. Because we can never again go back to policy of either separating families or releasing everyone. Yes,separating families is cruel. But so is release policy that incentivizes adults to unlawfully cross border with kids … Should pass bill we filed asap. It creates capacity to hold families together,sets standards for family detention,hires judges to speed up their hearing process,but also ends the release policy that enticed parents to bring children on dangerous journey to unlawfully enter U.S. Visited Homestead shelter for migrant children. We must make sure they are safe & cared for & held together with parents as soon as possible. But we MUST also end the cruel policies which incentivize parents to bring kids here on such a dangerous journey. … Wow what a surprise! Yet another American citizen working at embassy in #Cuba was injured. We have embassies in virtually every country on the planet but this only happens in two countries Cuba & #China … I know for a FACT that @FLOTUS has been a strong voice of compassion for migrant children. The vicious treatment of her over the last day is a reminder of how Trump Derangement Syndrome,where hatred for him justifies everything,has become an epidemic. Totally lunacy everywhere!!! We are AMERICA which means no matter the legality of their entry we MUST meet a higher standard in our treatment of vulnerable migrants,especially children. But we MUST also end the policies incentivizing adults to bring children on dangerous journey to unlawfully enter the U.S. ELISHA was filled with his spirit; He worked twice as many marvels & and every utterance of his mouth was wonderful. During his lifetime he feared no one, nor was anyone able to intimidate his will. Sirach 48:12 Charles Krauthammer was a man of extraordinary intellect. Truly one of a kind. The conservative movement & the nation will miss his incredible insight, especially in times such as these.  We offer our deepest condolences to his family. May he Rest In Peace … I have already filed a bill that would curb #China investment in industries critical to national security. Once this policy is finalized next week by Trump administration we will be filing an amendment to make permanent in law this much needed measure … Here you go, the long arm of China. At least John Oliver is standing up to them after he was censored in #China for mocking Chinese censorship. Most movie studios censor themselves to they can distribute films in China. … Earlier today I spoke on the Senate Floor about our immigration issues and the need for Congress to act if we want to enforce the law & also keep families together. Watch here:  I support a generous immigration system. I support responsibly accommodating those who came years ago as children & those who have been here a long time. But a policy which basically says if you unlawfully enter with children you will likely get to stay forever is irresponsible Based on Senate speeches Democrat position is: Don’t detain children; Don’t detain their parents either so we don’t separate families &; Don’t deport them if they fail to appear for subsequent hearing. So basically if you enter unlawfully with children we won’t enforce the law? Great news! The world is waking up to the #China threat. #Britain just held up a China aerospace deal over national security. This is why instead of a trade fight with Europe we should have teamed up with them to confront China together. #TheftTax … Wish big business backing #China on tariffs would realize if we continue to allow them to steal our innovations soon they will be shut out of China & have to compete against companies that stole their tech & are backed by low interest loans from China gov … The tariffs on #China are a #TheftTax & frankly could be more. China is stealing between $300 & $600 BILLION a year of American intellectual property. Enough is enough. … How exactly does helping save #ZTE give us leverage in broader negotiations with China? Giving in to their demands doesn’t create leverage, it emboldens them to see us as bluffers. Plus our national security should not be a bargaining chip anyway.  Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done,on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread; & forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;& do not subject us to the final test, but deliver us from the evil one.  Matthew 6: 9-13 Just heard Senate colleague on floor say U.S. detains immigrant children “indefinitely & indiscriminately”. That is just PATENTLY FALSE. They are entitled to due process hearing so not indefinite. And only applies to those who enter U.S. unlawfully so its not indiscriminate. Some Democrats now even using the disingenuous “indefinite detention” term. They know full well that those who unlawfully enter the U.S. are not held indefinitely. They are entitled to a due process hearing & our new bill hires more judges to speed up that process. The ink isn’t even dry on the new executive order ending separation policy & some Democrats already arguing that keeping families together isn’t enough. Now they want them & their parents released after unlawful entry knowing full well that high % will never appear for hearing It is cruel to separate families. But it’s also cruel & irresponsible to return to policy that encourages bringing children on a very dangerous journey. Our bill will change the law so families will remain together while awaiting prioritized proceedings. … Bill was just filed led by @SenThomTillis & many others like @SenatorFischer The executive order today does NOT take away the need for Congress to act. We need to get rid of the “Flores Settlement” or a court ruling could lead to same problem again. … Just filed the Keep Families Together Act. While todays reversal of decision to separate families is good,it will be challenged in court. Lets pass our law & get rid of “Flores Settlement” so adverse court decision doesn’t put us right back in same place. … President just announced the White House is going to do something to keep families together after unlawful entry. Waiting to see what it is. Meanwhile #ZTE issue is also heating up again, will be on Facebook Live at 12:30pm Eastern to discuss.   … Recently, I admitted that I was wrong about a bill I voted for while in the Florida Legislature. Here’s why my new bill makes more sense:pic.twitter.com/ckyqhAzlQV #ZTE poses a threat to entire U.S. telecommunication network not just our govt. #China already steals $300 billion a year from us,why would we allow them to stay in business & continue to embed internet routers & other key components into our networks? … Returning to a policy that only adults with children are released would create an incentive to bring kids. Yes separating families is cruel,but so is a policy that encourages parents to bring their kids on a dangerous journey. Instead lets #DetainandMaintain families together Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with Ethiopian dissident @eskindernega We must support freedom, liberty & democracy and those who are fighting for it.  #China get much of their technology by stealing it from the U.S. & by forc­ing U.S. com­pa­nies in China to trans­fer tech­nol­ogy to Chi­nese firms. We must confront China on this now before it’s too late. Trump policy on this is headed in right direction … Do not let anger upset your spirit, for anger lodges in the bosom of a fool. Ecclesiastes 7:9 If every Senator is willing to support it by unanimous consent, the Senate could pass a bill, before the end of the week, that would allow families charged with illegal entry to be kept together while awaiting an expedited hearing. I truly hope that is what we do. Led by @JohnCornyn a group of us are finalizing bill that will allow families to be held together pending expedited hearing. We can & must avoid BOTH creating incentive to unlawfully enter with children AND separating children from their parents … Releasing those who unlawfully enter b/c they came with children creates a cruel incentive to bring children on dangerous journey. Detaining parents is cruel because it separates families. Lets change the law so we can hold families together while awaiting expedited hearings Listen to counsel and receive instruction, that you may eventually become wise.  Proverbs 19:20 Tonight I issued a joint bi-partisan statement with @SenTomCotton, @SenSchumer, @ChrisVanHollen after the Senate today passed our #ZTE amendment. Chinese companies who steal from & spy on America should not be able to stay in business using our technology  #China has a new tactic it is using to pressure people inside the U.S., it is holding U.S. Citizens ‘Hostage’ in China under an “exit ban” to pressure their family members in America to cooperate. … Ortega is using the “national dialogue” in #Nicaragua as a stalling tactic to remain in power & leave his wife as the next President. Stringing along these talks & firing a few officials to deflect blame isn’t going to work. … Currently govt must either release parents & continue incentive for illegal entry with children or separate families by detaining parents. Neither is good. Lets change the law to allow families to be held together at family facilities & shorten detention with expedited hearings You are not a god who delights in evil;no wicked person finds refuge with you;the arrogant cannot stand before your eyes. You hate all who do evil;you destroy those who speak falsely. A bloody & fraudulent man the LORD abhors. Psalms 5: 5-7 Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up with the training and instruction of the Lord. Ephesians 6:4 One reaction on the 1st anniversary of Trump's #Cuba policy, we don’t have a bunch of big U.S. corporations all over D.C. lobbying us to go easy on their dictator business partners the way we did for a long time with #Nicaragua & still do with #China … Fatherhood in America is in decline. It comes with responsibilities all fathers need to fulfill. And it has an importance all of us need to to value, respect and encourage. #FathersDay2018 … #China started trade war blocking U.S. companies,stealing their intellectual property & forcing hand over of technology. Now they respond to ⁦new #TheftTax with tariffs that will raise price of food on their people. Lets see how that works out for them … But I say to you, love your enemies,& pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your heavenly Father, for he makes his sun rise on the bad & the good & causes rain to fall on the just & the unjust. Mt 5:43-45 Negotiations with Cuba & #NorthKorea are very different. Deal with Cuba was about rewarding dictatorship with diplomatic recognition in return for nothing. Negotiation with North Korea about avoiding nuclear war & millions dead. Kind of a big difference … #China issue isn’t just simple trade dispute. They are executing on a masterplan called "Made in China 2025" which aims to not just invest billions, but also cheat & steal their way into becoming the dominant industrial & high-tech country in the world. That’s what this is about. Article doesn’t go far enough. #China isn’t “warning” U.S. companies,it’s threatening them if they don’t lobby hard enough against Trump trade policy. That is why you will see many of them quoted in next few weeks attacking the #TheftTax on China … What do you think of Kanye West’s new album?pic.twitter.com/w1207wVgZ0 Senator @marcorubio, we are deeply grateful for your continued support of the Venezuelan people in our struggle for democracy and freedom. Today, more than ever, these shared values strengthen our unity and resolve.   Venezuela triunfará! … All of these abuses are being well documented. Not just Maduro, but those running these prisons & even the guards who carry out their inhuman orders will one day face justice both internationally & before the courts of a free & democratic #Venezuela … I support the #TheftTax imposed on #China by ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ 1000%. They are 211ing our innovations to establish technological dominance in key fields. We need to confront this now. It’s is almost too late to act so its now or never. … I admit I had initial reservations about Jim Bridenstine to head up @NASA but I am VERY impressed with the job he is doing. Very positive reviews. He deserves to have a deputy he chooses & Janet Kavandi would be a great choice!      Great news! We were able to increase to this years funding for #StopSchoolViolenceAct programs to $100 million. Identifying potential school attackers & strengthening school safety are two of the most important things we can do to keep our children & teachers safe. This is an EXCELLENT move by ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ most of these technology products from #China are made from technology stolen from U.S. companies. They steal over $300 billion worth of technology a year. So these aren’t tariffs they are a #TheftTax … Hollywood celebrities never pass up the chance to attack American conservatives but they make their millions on movies self censored to avoid #China censorship. Because if China is upset about a movie they will ban it & the studio’s future films as well … The heart of the just ponders a response, but the mouth of the wicked spews evil. Proverbs 15:28 I wonder why this isn’t receiving more focus in the media reports: “In addition,we identified instances where FBI employees improperly received benefits from reporters,including tickets to sporting events,golfing outings,drinks & meals, & admittance to nonpublic social events.” .@MariaCorinaYA esta con el pueblo de #Venezuela en su lucha por la libertad. Maduro y sus secuaces deberían pensarlo dos veces antes de amenazar su vida. EE. UU. y la comunidad internacional deben tomar nota y harán cumplir severas sanciones si su vida está en peligro @SecPompeo .@MariaCorinaYA stands with the people of #Venezuela in the fight for freedom. Maduro and his cronies should think twice before threatening her life. The U.S. & the international community should take note and will enforce severe sanctions if her life is in danger @SecPompeo Good for ⁦@AmericanAir⁩ ⁦@united⁩ & ⁦@Delta⁩ for standing up to #China bullying & refusing to cave to demand they call #Taiwan part of China. Wish more companies had the guts to stand up to them instead of lobbying D.C. for China’s agenda … I strongly support the great Americans at @FBI⁩ but the conduct of the senior officials outlined in this report has done tremendous damage to the bureau. Leaks to & gifts from reporters. Agents talking about how they are going to stop Trump from winning … CFIUS is process used to potentially block attempts by foreign companies to do deals which pose a threat to our national security. Giving big corporations the chance to get congress to overturn these decisions so they can make their big $ is terrible idea … Continuing to talk about how harsh the penalties are on #ZTE for violating sanctions is a effort to distract from the core issue. ZTE poses a significant threat to U.S. national security. If we can put them out of business we must & should. #Huaweiisnext … Today, we celebrate Old Glory and the 243rd birthday of our U.S. Army. Let us never forget the freedom our flag represents and the sacrifices made to defend our nation. #FlagDay #HBD #USArmypic.twitter.com/QRF7P4KPVN B While in #Florida legislature I voted for a bill that allowed state to suspend professional licenses of those who defaulted on student loans. I WAS WRONG. Today I filed a bill with @SenWarren to fix this. How can they pay back if they can’t work? #Sayfie … Some media reactions to @potus comments on #KJU are fair, may others are complete overreaction. But lost in the daily outrage cycle is  this critical FACT: Reason KJU is at table is sanctions. And they will remain in place until #NorthKorea denuclearizes … As I said yesterday in Foreign Relations hearing still time for a peaceful path forward in #Nicaragua    1. Allow NGO’s to help groups build political & electoral capacity  2. Intl supervised referendum on Ortega in 2018  3. Intl supervised presidential elections in early 19 Alarming increase in #Suicide is a reminder that we have serious problems in our country that are much deeper than our economy & can’t be measured by unemployment rate or GDP growth. The erosion of the family & of community is leaving people isolated … Why are we still giving so much money to the ⁦@UN⁩ ? The General Assembly vote was not just anti #Israel bias,it is anti-semitism disguised as international diplomacy. Totally grotesque that no mention of the evil acts committed by #Hamas … Timeline important. #China wants #NorthKorea talks to be step by step process of simultaneous actions which are synchronized & phased. Why? They want to force us into significant troop reduction in #SouthKorea & removal of THAAD missile defense system. … The naive believe everything,but the shrewd watch their steps. Proverbs 14:15 BTW @Apple who is very proud of how they are making it harder for American law enforcement to collect evidence from iPhones of criminals, had not problem turning over their ENTIRE CLOUD in #China to the Chinese government. Not just the phones ALL THE DATA … The next time someone asks “what’s the difference between what China telecomms do & what ours do?” show them this article. You think #Huawei or #ZTE can deny #China police ability to collect anything from their phones? … 3 months ago blocked foreign purchase of ZTE’s top U.S. supplier b/c it would endanger natl security & cede U.S. primacy in semiconductor & wireless industry. But now we are saving #ZTE by allowing them to continue to buy same critical technology? … The current deal with #ZTE does indeed make them pay a big price for violations of #NorthKorea & #Iran sanctions. But our governments oversight over business side of ZTE will not be able to protect the U.S. from the technical threat they pose to the U.S. … Important to remember #ZTE is about 2 seperate issues.  1: Sanctions violations. The penalties imposed for that are ok.  2: Risk they pose to our national security. This is the focus of our proposal. We should do NOTHING that keeps a national security threat in business ANYWHERE. Watch @FoxNews @AmericaNewsroom at 10AM will discuss how role of @potus & congress on #NorthKorea are different. He’s the negotiator who needs to try & strike a good deal. We have to define what is good & approve it as treaty instead of it being unconstitutional like #IranDeal … #EVerify is a very important reform.  And while it is true that we struggle to find U.S. workers for many agriculture jobs, that is NOT true of construction. Americans can & want to do construction work.  Yes the video @potus produced & played for #KJU is unusual. But he was meeting with a different kind of guy. The video should be the least of our concerns. It won’t hurt & showing the guy a little shine might actually work.   … #axiosam Drug lord @dcabellor knows full well he has lost many of the things he bought under other names with stolen money. One day they will be sold & hundreds of millions returned to legitimate government in #Venezuela to help repair damage regime has caused. … Now is a good time to start getting rid of your #Huawei investments. Because while #ZTE poses a very serious threat to the U.S. Huawei is 100 times worse. #Next … I bless the LORD who counsels me;even at night my heart exhorts me. I keep the LORD always before me; with him at my right hand, I shall never be shaken. Psalms 16: 7-8 One more thing about KJU. While I know @potus is trying to butter him up to get a good deal, #KJU is NOT a talented guy. He inherited the family business from his dad & grandfather. He is a total weirdo who would not be elected assistant dog catcher in any democracy. .@NickKristof I’m uncomfortable with suspending military exercises & if this becomes permanent in exchange for nothing you are 100% correct. However after Trump bent over backwards to be conciliatory, if #KJU does nothing, intl sanctions will be easier to enforce & increase … Any “deal” that doesn’t ultimately bring to an end these atrocities under #KimJongun is not a good deal. … Should be skeptical of any deal with #KJU Limits to future strategic weapons instead of eliminating current program not an acceptable outcome. Hope I’m wrong but still believe they will never give up nukes & ICBM’s unless believe failure to do so triggers regime ending reaction Presidents meeting with #KJU exposed incredible hypocrisy of many in media. When Obama did these things,he was described as enlightened. When Trump does it he is reckless & foolish. 1 yr ago they attacked Trump for leading us towards war,now attack for being too quick for peace I too have concerns about how all this with #NorthKorea will turn out. But I don’t recall all the “experts” criticizing Obama when he met with a brutal dictator in #Cuba who also oversaw a police state & also killed & jailed his opponents. #DoubleStandard … It is true @Potus did what previous administration didn’t do,punish #ZTE for sanctions violations. But this is about much more than sanctions violation. It is about the threat ZTE & #Huawei pose to U.S. telecomm infrastructure. … How long, O people, will you be hard of heart? Why do you love what is worthless, chase after lies? Psalms 4:3 Great news! Our bipartisan amendment restoring penalties on #ZTE is included in the #NDAA bill the Senate will be advancing to later this evening. The message from latest @ChickfilA incident is this: “Your church can still teach traditional marriage (which by the way we will still label as a bigoted belief) but don’t you dare repeat it outside of church or we will come after you, your business and/or your job.” .@ChickfilA isn’t denying service to anyone. But if you eat there you must be attacked by the twitter mob b/c owner agrees with what his church teaches about marriage? Why would twitter mob stop at biz owned by Christians? Who is next? Christian schools? Christian charities? This lunacy has gone too far. The CEO of @Twitter bullied into apology for patronizing @ChickfilA because owners support “biblical definition of marriage”. Holding a personal view taught by mainstream Christianity is now boycott worthy.  … via @cbsmoneywatch I STRONGLY support trans-Atlantic alliance & wish ⁦@POTUS⁩ would have dealt with #China before turning to trade with allies. That said, some seem to forget that his first obligation is to the American people not to the alliance. … Our #TaiwanTravelAct signed by @potus pushes for more high level visits. Opening of the compound in #Taiwan is perfect chance to start doing it. #China bullying & breaking promises on Hong Kong justifies Taiwan lack of enthusiasm for “reunification” … Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the clean of heart,for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers,for they will be called children of God. Matthew 5: 7-9 Thorns & thistles it shall bear for you,& you shall eat the grass of the field. By the sweat of your brow you shall eat bread, Until you return to the ground, from which you were taken; For you are dust, and to dust you shall return. Genesis 3: 18-19 Many valid points here. Our allies do impose unfair tariffs & non-tariff barriers on us. But we should first have worked with them to focus solely on #China & then dealt with these issues after. Read: The Era of American Complacency on Trade Is Over … One point is missed in this analysis. If #China tech companies use protection given by govt to grab  dominance in 5G or A.I. they become global standard & will dominate development in the fields that depend on those technologies like autonomous vehicles. … Here’s some advice for all of the recent high school and college graduates out there.pic.twitter.com/E6KWzbbqaJ Please read this story about an amazing family in need of a helping hand & the incredible people who helped them. A reminder that for every outrage you hear about there are countless stories of people doing wonderful things that you will never hear about. … God indeed is my salvation; I am confident and unafraid. For the LORD is my strength and my might,and he has been my salvation. Isaiah 12:2 What Kim Jong-un wants from summit is to be viewed as an important world leader that is reasonable,affable & equal to @potus & to be able to give elites in #NorthKorea hope for near term sanctions relief without giving more than vague commitments on nukes … As I said 2 days ago,U.S. not going to stand by & allow human rights abusers & those undermining democracy in #Nicaragua to spend their weekends vacationing in Miami. Today @StateDept @SecPompeo issued visa restrictions against some of them. More to come. … If the apps you download to your phone, like Facebook, can access your private information, imagine what a company like #ZTE which makes THE ACTUAL PHONE ITSELF can access! … After todays decision to give #ZTE a pass, we have introduced a bipartisan amendment to restore penalties on ZTE, & to prohibit the U.S. govt from purchasing any equipment or services from #Huawei or ZTE or using any grants or loans to subsidize them. … U.S. has had to evacuate some employees from #China after complaints of mystery illness. And we should have every reason to believe this is just the tip of the iceberg in both China & #Cuba … Next time ⁦@CommerceGov⁩ says problem with #ZTE was only about sanctions violations & that all they make are phones remember this article. If you can be spied on due to malware you load on a phone, imagine if the spy actually made the phone itself! … Why is #ZTE and #Huawei a big threat? #China already on verge of becoming global leader in 5G. Will have full scale deployment by 2020 & have approval for stations in Europe. This will allow them to dominate autonomous vehicles & Internet of Things. All using tech stolen from us I’m rooting for the Knights. How about you?pic.twitter.com/5xKA2aEDbn I assure you with 100% confidence that #ZTE is a much greater national security threat than steel from Argentina or Europe. #VeryBadDeal This “deal” with #ZTE may keep them from selling to Iran and North Korea. That’s good. But it will do nothing to keep us safe from corporate & national security espionage. That is dangerous. Now Congress will need to act to keep America safe from #China Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD alone! Therefore, you shall love the LORD, your God, with your whole heart, and with your whole being, and with your whole strength. Take to heart these words which I command you today. Deuteronomy 6: 4-6 When all is said & done the attacks in #China will prove to be broader than initially suspected & potentially related to the attacks in #Cuba … Me reuní con líderes de la Coalición Universitaria de Nicaragua y Migueliuth Sandoval, Viuda de Gahona, hablamos sobre las atrocidades cometidas por el régimen de #Ortega. Apoyo su lucha por la democracia y la libertad en #Nicaraguapic.twitter.com/10he6P6E6P I met with leaders of the Nicaraguan University Coalition and Migueliuth Sandoval, widow of Gahona, SPOKE about the atrocities being committed by the #Ortega regime. I support their fight for democracy and freedom in #Nicaragua On this day in 1944, 160,000 fearless Allied troops led the charge to beat the reign of Nazi terror. The heroism of these fearless soldiers will never be forgotten. #DDaypic.twitter.com/eDXYirjO5e Why didn’t @facebook just reveal this data sharing deal with #Huawei months ago? And don’t compare this to deals with other telecomms.

She is going to be a great Governor for her state. We need to help her win in November. We need more leaders like her in public service. … Republicans nominated three strong female candidates for governor tonight: @KristiNoem in SD, @KimReynoldsIA in Iowa, & @KayIveyForGov in AL. All three are clear favorites in November & are tremendous leaders for their states. @The_RGA #China on the verge of winning again. They mock us by appointing someone from another sanctioned company as the supposed “watchdog” over #ZTE & we respond by helping ZTE stay in business. Great deal for China.   … via @bpolitics The images from #Guatemala after the volcanic eruption are heartbreaking. Today I will be speaking to @StateDept to see how we can provide assistance in the recovery. #PrayForGuatemala Very happy for @willainsworthAL With your help he will be the next   of #Alabama … This is great news. @RepKristiNoem is going to be a GREAT Governor of #SouthDakota now let’s go help her win in November!!!  … Show us favor, LORD, show us favor, for we have our fill of contempt. Our souls are more than sated with mockery from the insolent, with contempt from the arrogant. Psalms 123: 3-4 This situation in #Nicaragua has now reached a very dangerous point & could escalate rapidly. Expect to see it take on a higher profile in U.S. policy in the days to come. … This could be a very big problem. If @Facebook granted Huawei special access to social data of Americans this might as well have given it directly to the government of #China … My batting average on #UFvsFSU jokes is below the Mendoza line but another swing here: cheering on @FSU_Softball as they take on @UWSoftball in the #WCWS! Hope they bring home a win for the Sunshine State. And yes, my #FSU staffers made write this @NCAAsoftball #Sayfie .@KristiNoem is a great friend in Congress and has always been a strong supporter. I encourage you to vote for her in the Republican primary for Governor of South Dakota today!  … Alabama - @willainsworthAL will make a great Lieutenant Governor and is a hardworking member of #TeamMarco. Get out and vote for him today in the GOP primary:  Republicans in Iowa have the chance to nominate a strong, principled conservative for Secretary of Agriculture today in @DanZumbach. Vote today:  We will continue to try to help the people of #Haiti but as I warned over a year ago, their government leaders refusal to condemn the crimes committed by the #MaduroRegime in #Venezuela has sadly begun to impact their relationship with the U.S. … A veteran of the U.S. Army tried to spy for #China according to @FBI … It’s not just in the U.S. that #China is forcing private companies to kneel. Now @Qantas has surrendered to China on #Taiwan as well. … Missing in all this analysis of #SCOTUS ruling is that their is a difference between refusing to offer general services to someone because of their orientation & not being forced to offer services for a marriage ceremony that violates ones religious belief … Only limit to @Google operating in #Cuba are those imposed by regime. Changes made by @potus to Cuba policy deliberately exclude telecommunications & internet from U.S. limits. Do you think maybe someone should mention that fact in one of these article?   … #China is completely clowning the U.S. Their “good faith” gesture to get ban lifted on #ZTE was to replace a top executive with a guy from another company THAT IS ALSO SANCTIONED FOR BEING A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT! How did @CommerceGov fall for that? … Fill us at daybreak with your mercy,that all our days we may sing for joy. Make us glad as many days as you humbled us,for as many years as we have seen trouble. Show your deeds to your servants,your glory to their children. May the favor of the Lord our God be ours. Ps90:14-17 This is how #China uses our own large businesses as a weapon against our national interests. U.S. telecomms are pushing to use tax-payer funded subsidies to buy #ZTE & #Huawei gear & then use in America. Basically China wants YOU to pay for their spying! … #China now undertaking a blatant effort to use a pric­ing “in­ves­ti­ga­tion” to harass & pressure chip mak­ers, including a U.S. company, to transfer technology to them. We should always remember that China plays hardball, we must as well. … Our bill named the Asia Re­as­sur­ance Ini­tia­tive Act #ARIA would go a long way to standing up to #China aggression by af­firming our al­liance with #Aus­tralia #Japan #SouthKorea & call­ing for deeper mil­i­tary & eco­nomic ties with #In­dia & #Taiwan … Finally, all of you, be of one mind, sympathetic, loving toward one another, compassionate, humble. Do not return evil for evil, or insult for insult; but, on the contrary, a blessing, because to this you were called, that you might inherit a blessing  1 Peter 3: 8-9 Every day seems to bring a new story of a U.S. company apologizing to #China for something about #Taiwan or #Tibet This means #China now censors corporate speech in America. Unreal. … O God, you are my God it is you I seek! For you my body yearns; for you my soul thirsts, In a land parched, lifeless, and without water. I look to you in the sanctuary to see your power and glory. For your love is better than life; my lips shall ever praise you! Psalm 63:2-4 Thank you to @TKAWPB for inviting me to speak at your senior graduation. It was an honor to share this special night with you.

They have cheated & stolen themselves into a position where they now have 9 of the world’s biggest internet companies which is almost as many as the U.S. … Trade rebalance with #China isn’t a $ for $ issue. It needs to be about fair competition in the industries that will drive & define the 21st century economy like biotech­,A.I.,nan­otech­,digital,aerospace etc. That’s why China steals IP in those fields … Read here how spies can use your cellphone to find you & eavesdrop on your calls & texts. Imagine how much easier it is for them to do it if their companies (like Huawei & #ZTE) made your phone & much of the equipment in the cellular network! … Eu­rope & Asia also have major concerns about  #China stealing & unfair practices. But instead of joining us to confront China, our tariffs against them is making it easier for China to line them up against us. #BeSmart #BeStrategic … We have trade inequities with the E.U. that need to be addressed. But the threat posed by #China dwarfs all the other trade imbalances combined. Instead of opening up another front in trade disputes, we should be teaming up with Europe to confront China. … The LORD has removed the judgment against you, he has turned away your enemies; The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst, you have no further misfortune to fear.   Zephaniah 3:15 The hits just keep on coming. Read here how #China is increasingly buying or reverse-engineering big tech breakthroughs and transforming them into cheap, commodity products. … I am proud to be supporting my friend, @DanZumbach for Iowa Secretary of Agriculture. His campaign has my full support.  Instead of helping @NicolasMaduro consolidate power the fake elections in #Venezuela further isolated his regime. Yesterday the E.U. announced upcoming sanctions, now today #Canada sanctions his wife & 13 other members of #MaduroRegime … We have been “urging” #China to address cyber theft, forced technology transfer & discriminatory industrial policies for years. But urging doesn’t work with them. Need to impose clear price for that or soon won’t be any U.S. companies left to protect. … Another great move! Imposing limits on some Chinese visas may seem harsh,but it’s necessary. #China poses unprecedented threat. Student & academic visas are another weapon they use against us in their campaign to steal & cheat their way to world dominance … Great move yesterday by @Potus to confront #China on its economic abuses. But in a sign of the derangement that has infected our politics,some are so anti-Trump they parrot the Chinese criticism of his decision. This attitude that “if Trump is for it, it must be bad” is crazy. Glorify the LORD, Jerusalem; Zion, offer praise to your God, For he has strengthened the bars of your gates, blessed your children within you. He brings peace to your borders,& satisfies you with finest wheat. He sends his command to earth; his word runs swiftly! Psalms 147:12-15 In 2015 Xi Jin­ping’s pledged not to mil­i­tarize islands in #SouthChinaSea . Then he went ahead & did exactly that. It is part of #China govt pattern of deception, deceit & total disregard of the law. … This is why there can’t & won’t be better relations between the U.S. & the regime of @NicolasMaduro The crimes outlined in this report from an independent panel of experts are horrifying. #Venezuela … Here we go again. @Costco is latest U.S. company facing threats from #China for its stance on #Taiwan It should trouble all Americans that we have companies & people in our country being censored by the Chinese govt with threat of losing access to market … 100% right decision by Trump admin to place restrictions on #Chi­na acquisition of sensitive Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy. The theft, forced transfer & purchase of key tech is big part of their plan to overtake U.S. & become world preeminent power. #GoodMove … Give @Potus credit for achieving what no one else has,forcing #NKorea to table. War would be very bad so should give talks every chance to succeed. However while I truly hope I’m wrong, I remain skeptical #KJU will ever agree to voluntarily give up nukes. … Why should we allow any #China telecomm to operate in or buy sensitive technology from U.S. when @DeptofDefense says #Huawei & #ZTE devices “pose an unacceptable risk” to military & @ODNIgov @FBI & @CIA openly say they are a potential security risks to the American people? Yesterday the @EU_Commission demanded new #Venezuela elections & announced it is preparing more sanctions against the regime of @NicolasMaduro  … This is why cuts to military spending are so harmful. A new report issues a troubling warning; If the U.S. finds itself in a major conflict, the U.S. defense industry may not be able to produce enough munitions to keep up with demand. … “But many that are first will be last, and [the] last will be first.” Mark 10:31 Subtropical Storm #Alberto making landfall along the #FloridaPanhandle  Be careful, listen to local authorities. Storm will pass soon, stay off the roads & indoors until it is safe to go outside. #BeSmart #BeSafe #Florida #sayfie … Mistake to view #ZTE or any other issue that touches on #China in a vacuum. They are executing on a comprehensive plan to achieve world domination. Use trade,commerce,debt,military,immigration,technology, science & propaganda as tools. We need to wake up! … Unlike #Maduro, yesterday #Colombia held a real election. Now in a run-off the people will get to pick between a candidate from the right & one from the left, but both democrats. This is what the people of #Venezuela & #Cuba deserve as well. #Democracy … #China seeks to surpass the US in every field. That includes having a military more powerful & capable than ours. Which is why they have dramatically increased the pace of testing of new generation nuclear weapons.  pic.twitter.com/p5v04ojjcW Today we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our nation’s freedom.   "Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends." John 15:13pic.twitter.com/2DeZj2ZrYE #coreypatrick family didn’t have a car so he was up at 4:00 am everyday to get to school across town because he was determined to graduate. Picture of him taking bus in his cap & gown to graduation went viral. Then @RickeySmiley stepped in. Watch here: … .@WhiteHouse makes clear release of #JoshHolt will not change #Venezuela policy. Until @NicolasMaduro holds free elections,releases all political prisoners & allows humanitarian aid, all pressure on Maduro regime will continue & increase:  … via @whitehouse What a great moment for #JoshHolt & his family & the members of congress @BobCorker @senorrinhatch @RepMiaLove @SenMikeLee who worked so hard to bring him home. The end of his unjust captivity as a hostage of a brutal regime was long overdue. … For the sake of peace I sincerely hope I am wrong about Kim Jong Un not being serious about getting rid of his weapons. But so far, I have seen no evidence that I am wrong. @realDonaldTrump has handled this very well so far but the most difficult part lies ahead. … Will be on @FaceTheNation this morning to discuss #NKorea #ZTE #China & #Venezuela … “And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age.” Matthew 28:20 We welcome the release of Joshua & Thamara Holt, who were unjustly imprisoned in #Venezuela. U.S. policy toward Venezuela remains unchanged. We support the Venezuelan people & their efforts to return to democracy. We wish Joshua & his family the best after this difficult period. #JoshHolt release was unconditional. He was a hostage who was not involved in #Venezuela politics & had done nothing wrong. This article is accurate in saying there was “no quid pro quo or agreement to ease U.S. sanctions tied to” his release. … The return of hostage #JoshHolt is great news. Very happy for his family. But sadly 32 million people are still being held hostage by @NicolasMaduro The only “goodwill gesture” that will lift sanctions is the return of democracy. … #China wants to become most powerful country in the world & weaken the U.S.. We must come together to address this challenge with a plan to invest & reform education,space,A.I.,5G, Quantum Computing & infrastructure. … .@senorrinhatch has worked tirelessly to bring this innocent young man & his bride home. It is unfortunate he had to go through this. Josh & Thamy Holt had nothing to do with internal politics in #Venezuela #GodisGood … I am very happy for Josh Holt & his family. He was an innocent America hostage in #Venezuela & his UNCONDITIONAL release was long overdue. For administration this is about right penalty for #ZTE violating sanctions. For me its about #China stealing tech & IP to catch up to & surpass us. They are not going to stop until they face significant consequences. Such as ZTE going out of business … Maduro swearing-in early,calls for dialogue & gestures of goodwill are all part of his effort to consolidate support in the face of growing discontent within his own government. But the ONLY action that will remove U.S. sanctions is the return of democracy … La postura de el gobierno de el Presidente Trump es bien claro: “EEUU acusa a Maduro de cometer “crímenes contra la humanidad” en #Venezuela”   … … Any U.S. Senator can meet with whoever they want. But no matter how many senators dictator @NicolasMaduro gets to meet with him, U.S. sanctions will go away when Maduro leaves & democracy returns.pic.twitter.com/EcHZC9ELcN Maduro se puede reúnir con 50 senadores y la postura de E.E.U.U. no va ha cambiar si no hay democracia. … Another absurd analysis. If after 65 years S.Korea can get N.Korea to act responsibly without U.S. maximum pressure that’s great news. Good luck with that! And if China welcomes even stronger U.S. military in Asia, they should go ahead & support N.Korea … This is how far our domestic political derangement has come. Summit failure blamed on lack of “message discipline” by Trump officials & not on the paranoid dictator who inherited, not earned, his power, & who stays in power through deception & murder … Kim Jong un stays in power through force & deception & believes nukes give him prestige & reduce chances of U.S. attack. He never wanted a nuke deal,he wanted as much sanctions relief as possible without giving them up. Unfortunately the options on dealing with him are narrowing Yes they have a deal in mind. It is a great deal... for #ZTE & China. #China crushes U.S. companies with no mercy & they use these telecomm companies to spy & steal from us. Many hoped this time would be different. Now congress will need to act. … Drip drip drip...#China gets another country to drop diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. #Taiwan is a democracy & loyal U.S. ally. We MUST do more to help them. Right now I see no strategy to help them at all. Very sad & bad message about our loyalty. … True. But #MajorKey its not every day a quote from Miami’s own fits so perfectly. #AnotherOne … Kim Jun Un, in the words of a wise man “Congratulations, you just played yourself”. Withdrawing from talks with #NKorea is 100% the right decision. #KJU doesn’t want a deal. He has deliberately sabotaged the talks over the last two weeks & was setting us up to take the blame. #NKorea “shutting down” test site is a show to make #KJU appear cooperative & responsible.  Bottom line is they either give up nukes & missiles or they don’t. I suspect they don’t want a deal,but want U.S. blamed for it so international sanctions collapse … Time will tell whether they can report on China without interference. We should watch this closely. I hope they can pull it off and be able to report honestly and openly. Had ok article yesterday. We shall see. But if not, they should be registered as foreign agent. Maybe this partnership between @politico & Chinese owned newspaper should be required to register as foreign agent. All media in #China operates with the permission of Communist Party. Can this partnership really report without interference from China? … Not credible to claim that @CommerceGov needs to change punishment on #ZTE because they didn’t intend to put them out of business. Everyone knew what cutting them off from buying U.S. semi-conductors would do. So what is reason to change penalty now?  Do not fear when a man becomes rich, when the wealth of his house grows   his death he will not take along anything, his glory will not go down after him. Psalms 49: 17-18 The Democrats are basically blocking everything they can but we are making progress on judicial appointments, foreign policy, and supporting American workers.pic.twitter.com/I6SpwhY9Rn Yet another example of #China trying to bully American companies. These guys play hard ball. Do not feel bad for #ZTE or any Chinese company going out of business. They have put plenty of American companies out of business by stealing from them.
