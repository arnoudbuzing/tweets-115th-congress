This was particularly recognized in the last #FarmBill process when Congress, led by this Committee, created the position of the Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs at USDA. #agtrade #FarmBill18 Roberts: Along with #FarmBill18, I hear about #agtrade. I hear from wheat growers about the need for market access. I hear from beef producers about barriers to trade. I hear from producers about trade policies impacting prices, decisions & livelihoods. These aren't new concerns. Roberts: As I’ve traveled through Kansas and around the country, having #FarmBill18 in place certainly tops the list of concerns I hear. The conference committee is doing our work to get a bill to the finish line as soon as possible. #agtrade Roberts: The last couple of years have been very busy for the Members of the Senate Ag Committee, as we’ve worked hard to produce the #FarmBill18 that will provide certainty and predictability for U.S. farmers, ranchers, and growers. #agtrade Chairman @SenPatRoberts has hit the gavel on today's #agtrade hearing.

Thank you @SenStabenow @SenPatRoberts @ConawayTX11 @collinpeterson for your leadership in the conference committee process and for continuing to #ProtectCropInsurance in #farmbill18. Watch today's public meeting here:   #farmbill conference: @SenPatRoberts says "Getting a farm bill done paramount to any other issue and concern...very close to finish line but lot of compromise that needs to be done." Working on his 8th #FarmBill @SenPatRoberts chairing conference committee meeting - "Getting a farm bill done is PARAMOUNT to any other issue" #farmers #whathesaidpic.twitter.com/zWNzOL4f1l Roberts: Most important, we must agree to a bill that provides our farmers, ranchers, and other rural stakeholders much needed certainty and predictability. #farmbill18 Roberts: We must do our job. We MUST agree to a bill that provides producers certainty and predictability they deserve. We must commit to making the tough choices—and compromising to find common ground—to develop the best bill possible under these circumstances. #farmbill18 Roberts: But, we must embrace the attitude of our producers --optimism and ingenuity. A farmer doesn’t plant the seed in the ground without the faith and optimism of harvesting a good crop. #farmbill18 Roberts: As I travel across Kansas, producers are facing the wrath of Mother Nature. Some farms are facing drought, others floods. Many producers are not looking forward to harvest, let alone the tough conversations with their lenders in the weeks ahead. #farmbill18 Roberts: Agriculture, and specifically the #FarmBill, has consistently answered the call to do more with less. And, to those who say passing a Farm Bill in this environment is a daunting task, I say together we can get it done. #farmbill18 Roberts: We must make tough choices and be judicious with the scarce resources we have. Each of our Committees have asked tough questions and reexamined programs to determine effectiveness over the last several years. We must ensure programs accomplish their purposes. #farmbill18 Roberts: We need to grow more and raise more with fewer resources. That will take investments in research, new technology, lines of credit, and proper risk management. It takes the government providing tools, and then getting out of the producer’s way. #farmbill18 Roberts: With trade & market uncertainty, we must provide certainty for trade & research prgms. Feeding an increasing population is not just an ag challenge, it's a national security challenge. Show me a country that cannot feed itself; I’ll show you a nation in chaos #farmbill18 Roberts: We can improve SNAP integrity w verification process changes, better quality control oversight & elimination of much of state performance bonuses. These could bring accountability & reduce error rates, which have resulted in billions in improper payments. #farmbill18 Roberts: We can find ways to provide tools to states, to people, to employers and to non-profits that will get people working again. #farmbill18 Roberts: I share the goal of promoting work & self-sufficiency among SNAP participants. Investments in employment & training that demonstrate success, partnerships w/ the private sector, & more accountability can help get folks back on the path to longterm employment. #farmbill18 Roberts: We must focus on program integrity and commonsense investments to strengthen our nutrition programs to ensure the pathway to long-term success of those in need of assistance. #farmbill18 Roberts: Let us not forget that in a few short decades, the global population will top 9 billion people. Ag will need to double in the near future to meet that demand. Accomplishing this task requires efficiency, not just on the farm & ranch, but also in government. #farmbill18 Roberts: We must ensure that our voluntary conservation programs are keeping farm land in operation while protecting our agriculture lands, forests, and other natural resources. #farmbill18 Roberts: We are endeavoring to craft a #FarmBill18 that meets the needs of producers across all regions and all crops. All of agriculture is struggling, not just one or two commodities. We must have a bill that works across our great nation. Roberts: It is not an exaggeration to say our nation’s food and fiber production capability hangs in the balance with what we do here on the #farmbill. Time is of the essence. Let us work together to get this done. #farmbill18 Roberts: Both the House and Senate have taken the steps to get us to this point today. We are very close to the finish line, but we still have a lot of work—a lot of compromise—that remains to be done. #farmbill18 Roberts: The goal, the responsibility, the absolute requirement is to provide farmers, ranchers, growers & everyone w/i America’s ag and food value chain certainty & predictability during these difficult times. This is paramount to many other issues and concerns. #farmbill18 Roberts: This is the 8th #farmbill that I’ve been a part of  during my time in public service. The circumstances are always different, but we all have a history of working together in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to find solutions and to get farm bills done. #farmbill18 Roberts: Today, we continue that tradition as we work to agree on legislation that is critically important to our nation—the 2018 Farm Bill. #FarmBill18 Roberts: I thank Chairman Conaway for passing the gavel to the Senate for the duration of the #FarmBill18 Conference. I recall a day in 1996, when as the House Ag Committee Chairman, I passed the gavel to the Chairman of the Senate Ag Committee at the time—Senator Richard Lugar.

There is no greater threat to national security, than food security. I am incredibly proud of the role that U.S. agriculture plays in “feeding a troubled and hungry world”. Roberts: Around the world we see increasing challenges emerge in food security. Mother Nature is one of them. If we don’t equip producers with tools (biotechnology & other plant breeding innovations) the risk of food insecurity, and even famine, will increase dramatically. Roberts: In #FarmBill18, we must continue to build upon that innovation and find new ways to strengthen ag research, not just at home, but abroad as well. We must constantly be pursuing the next “Green Revolution.” Roberts: In a time when we hear a lot about gridlock and partisanship, I am fortunate to lead a Committee that has proven to be the exception. Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow and I have a long history of overcoming serious challenges to get things done. #FarmBill18 Roberts: Nutrition programs & policies evolved through the #FarmBill. The Ag Committee is currently crafting a new Farm Bill. It's our responsibility to ensure programs are supported/strengthened. We'll look for new ways to allow our producers to do what they do best—feed people. Roberts: McGovern-Dole and Food for Peace, along with programs like Food for Progress, and Farmer to Farmer, are just a few examples of how U.S. producers have stepped up to meet the challenge of food security. Roberts: My good friend and mentor Bob Dole, a former recipient of the Gene White Lifetime Achievement Award, understood that food security is about more than just food. Roberts: In 1953, a Kansas farmer had the idea that U.S. farmers could give aid to other countries around the world in the form of food. With the support of KS Sens Schoeppel & Carlson, and ultimately President Eisenhower, the Food for Peace program @USAIDFFP was signed into law. Roberts: As Senate Ag Chairman, I represent the farmers, ranchers & growers responsible for feeding a troubled and hungry world. I take the job very seriously. Our producers play a critical role in ensuring a safe and reliable food supply. It has always been that way.

More on his nomination here:  … ICYMI watch my opening statement at today's #CFTC hearing on #cryptocurreny with @giancarloCFTC  … NEW VIDEO: Chairman @SenPatRoberts Hears #Cryptocurrency Update from #CFTC Chairman @giancarloCFTC  … Roberts: Whether it’s market participants who rely on the #CFTC to provide regulatory certainty, or consumer financial advocates who highlight the need for robust oversight of the market; I think everyone can agree we need a full panel of commissioners at the CFTC. Roberts: We will move forward on consideration of the additional vacant #CFTC commissioner spot as soon as an individual is nominated. We need to move forward and get a fully functioning CFTC. Roberts: Without an additional #CFTC commissioner, finalizing important rules is made much more difficult. We would like Dawn Stump, who was reported out of the committee last year, confirmed as soon as possible. The hold of her pending nomination is unacceptable. Roberts: We continue to hear from important derivative end-users in the ag sector and beyond, eagerly awaiting resolution to important rule makings mandated under #DoddFrank. Roberts: We are seeing how the decisions of European officials regarding cross border financial regulations may upend carefully negotiated agreements that would otherwise provide regulatory certainty to financial stakeholders operating on an international stage. #Brexit Roberts: The technology underlying cryptocurrencies has transformative potential. #Blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, may offer the economy significant benefits as it is used to create more secure, transparent and efficient ways for record keeping. Roberts: This hearing is timely, especially in the derivatives sector where commodities like #Bitcoin & cryptocurrencies, are discussed not only among large financial institutions on Wall Street, but also retail purchasers trying to determine the role cryptocurrencies should play Roberts: Because #cryptocurrency offerings, and the technologies they are built upon are skyrocketing, regulators like the #CFTC are working hard to provide consumer protection, but without stifling further innovations in the market. Roberts: Today, we'll examine issues within the derivatives markets space, including key end-user rules pending before the #CFTC, status of cross border equivalency agreements, and determining the proper role of regulators in the evolving market of cryptocurrencies. Chairman @SenPatRoberts has gaveled in today's #CFTC oversight hearing.

The Ag Committee last held a hearing on this subject over a decade ago, and significance of this issue has grown. Roberts: The 2015 Avian Influenza outbreak was unprecedented. While USDA managed through the situation as well as could be expected, it showed how vulnerable the ag sector is to such an event. It’s made everyone involved begin to think about ways in which we can improve. (2/2) Roberts: Biological threats, whether naturally occurring, like the avian influenza outbreak of 2015, or intentionally introduced, could pose great harm to our food supply and economy. (1/2) Roberts: The National Bio and Agro-defense Facility (NBAF) in Manhattan, Kansas, will be a critical part of keeping US agriculture, our food supply, economy, and most important, our people, safe. Roberts: In 1999, as Chairman of the newly-formed Emerging Threats Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I became aware of the threat our nation faced against intentionally introduced pathogens to be weaponized and aimed at destroying plant and animal populations. Roberts: Today, we'll hear about an issue of the utmost importance, not only to farmers, ranchers and the ag value chain, but also to consumers, the American economy and the safety of our country. Ag security is a broad reaching issue and involves many govt agencies, beyond USDA. Chairman @SenPatRoberts has gaveled in today's hearing on agriculture security.

Agriculture should be front and center as the U.S. pursues trading opportunities around the world. Roberts: We are at a crossroads on trade. If the U.S. is to continue both as a leader in the global market and to grow the American economy, then we must aggressively work to strengthen existing relationships, and develop new ones. #NAFTA Roberts: I believe we should be aggressively seeking new agreements and trading opportunities around the world. If the U.S. isn’t leading the charge and setting the rules, the European Union or others will be. Roberts: Canada and Mexico have been continuously ranked in the top 5 destinations for U.S. exports since #NAFTA was signed into law. We must work hard to continue to cultivate and grow that mutually beneficial relationship. Roberts: U.S. ag has grown because of agreements like #NAFTA. From the farmer in the field to the grocer in the store, American workers have benefited from that growth. Roberts: Trade is more than a product crossing a border. A seed planted in a field ultimately becomes a meal for a family, but in between you’ll find the combine that harvests it, the facility that processes it, and most important the people employed at every step of the way.pic.twitter.com/1LVQwlM2Xe Roberts: I joined Senator @JohnBoozman & 16 Senators in requesting that before committing to any changes in #NAFTA, the economic analysis illustrating the impact on the full supply chain of industries involved be shared. Roberts: There's a lot of frustration in farm country because we're missing opportunities to grow our exports. #NAFTA renegotiation could provide just that opportunity. Strengthening and modernizing NAFTA should result in even stronger economic growth for the US, Canada & Mexico. Roberts: I've been encouraging everyone – farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, Senators, Administration officials – to fight the pervasive view that our economy has not benefited from #NAFTA. I thank Ambassador Baucus and Senator Lugar for their efforts.pic.twitter.com/zlueuXA4ia Roberts: I've also heard from folks around the country that they need reliable markets, both domestically and abroad, to sell not just the things that we make, but also the commodities that we grow. Roberts: In preparation for writing #FarmBill18, I’ve been talking with folks all over the country, and one thing is clear: times are challenging in farm country. We're going to do what we can to provide farmers with certainty they need to be successful producers. Roberts at @WITA_DC: As the Chairman of the Senate Ag Committee, my primary task is to work on behalf of farmers, ranchers, growers, and other rural stakeholders in Kansas and across the country.pic.twitter.com/BpaDfpXIL3 USDA nominee Stephen Vaden has been approved by the Senate Ag Committee.
