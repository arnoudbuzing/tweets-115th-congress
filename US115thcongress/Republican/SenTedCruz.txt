I'm thankful to @SenTedCruz for working w our colleagues on both sides of the aisle in moving bill forward. Gracias, amigo! … Honored to join my fellow colleagues along with Christian pastors and ministry leaders for a time of prayer and discussion on the 228th inaugural anniversary of President George Washington. -->  pic.twitter.com/rycNQCuzDz Proud to work w my colleagues across the aisle to address the national security & domestic concerns of the American people. These three bills do just that. They are strong, bipartisan measures that seek to promote American strength abroad & defend freedom & justice here at home. Proud to see three of my bills which address international & domestic issues today advanced in the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs & the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations markups today with strong bipartisan support. -->   ICYMI at @SenateCommerce: "Millions of Texans & Americans across the country believe that big tech companies are actively censoring the speech of Americans & silencing the voices of conservatives. One of the frustrating things about this is that there’s almost no transparency."pic.twitter.com/D97HKDmcwA Today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed Joe and @SenTedCruz’s STOP Using Human Shields Act. The bill would impose sanctions on those who use or facilitate the use of human shields, such as Hamas, Hezbollah, Al Qaeda, and ISIS.pic.twitter.com/NpKV8CTKBY Expanding the use of these grants will empower our community leaders and education officials with the resources they need to strengthen our schools, hire school safety officers, and keep our children safe. -->   Much like the majority of Texans, I believe the number one thing that makes schools safer is having more armed police officers on campuses. Texas has not been exempt from the horror of school shootings. All of us have been horrified by the violent attacks on our students. These students, along with parents, local school boards, teachers, and communities across the country want a solution. Today @marcorubio and I introduced the School Security Enhancement Act, which allows local communities to utilize Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE) grants for measures that reinforce school safety infrastructure and technology. -->   This legislation recognizes the vital role state & local entities serve in safeguarding America’s critical infrastructure & protecting our nation from cybersecurity risks & terrorist threats. -->   Streamlining this relationship allows for a more sustainable approach to cybersecurity. I commend the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee for advancing @JohnCornyn & my bill to solidify cooperation between the Department of Homeland Security & the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, which partners w universities including @UTSA & @TAMU. Proud to work with my colleagues in this bipartisan effort and I am hopeful that additional public interest will bring revelation, justice, and closure where it has long been lacking. -->   Our bill attempts to address this by disclosing case records so that private detectives, historians, victims, and victims’ families may access these files, pursue leads, and document these tragic events. Unfortunately, many violent crimes committed against black families struggling for equality during this time were never solved. The bill would require the review, declassification, and release of government records related to unsolved criminal civil rights cases. The civil rights movement triumphed by securing for millions of people their rightful share in the American Dream. Glad to see the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs reported out @SenDougJones and my Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 today with strong bipartisan support. -->   Together, @JohnCornyn and I continue to urge the administration to secure the release of Austin Tice, a journalist & former U.S. Marine from Houston, TX, who was captured in Syria six years ago. #FreeAustinTice … We passed the Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act, a bill I joined @SenatorMenendez, @SenTedCruz & @SenBillNelson in introducing to address the escalating crisis in #Nicaragua and hold the Ortega regime & other human rights abusers accountable. 4/6 I look forward to the Senate swiftly passing this bill. #NicaAct #Nicaragua -->   As Nicaraguans across the country take a stand against this brutal dictator, the US must use its leverage to stop the flow of international finance to the regime until democratic reforms occur, and those responsible for corruption and human rights violations are held accountable. #Nicaragua is facing the largest uprising since the civil war ended nearly 30 years ago. Daniel Ortega and his Marxist strongmen have systematically repressed the people of Nicaragua by dismantling the country’s electoral institutions and violently silencing the opposition. Today the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to report bipartisan legislation, built in part on my #NicaAct, to hold President Daniel Ortega and his regime accountable for its human rights abuses and corruption in Nicaragua. -->   Breaking: Senate Foreign Relations Committee passes S.3257.

Read our statement:  pic.twitter.com/ui3Jx785aa I am hopeful the full Senate will move swiftly to advance this important legislation. By advancing this legislation, we are taking a stand against terrorist groups, including and especially Hamas and Hezbollah, who have built their military infrastructure and strategy around using human shields as cover for attacks on Israeli civilians. I commend the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for moving forward with my bipartisan bill, co-sponsored by 44 senators, to hold terrorists accountable for using innocent civilians as human shields. -->   Great meeting with Mayor Williams and other leaders from @CityOfAbilene discussing the future of Dyess Air Force Base and the B-21 bomber.pic.twitter.com/KzRPDmIYOb Live now!

This bipartisan legislation expands humanitarian relief efforts to the people of #Venezuela, while holding the Venezuelan regime accountable for human rights violations through increased economic, political, and diplomatic pressure. This week, I joined @SenatorMenendez & colleagues in introducing the #Venezuela Humanitarian Relief, Reconstruction, and Rule of Law Act of 2018. -->   I applaud @POTUS' latest move targeting Maduro's innermost circle w sanctions.

Until today, presidents from both parties let the PLO keep an office open in DC, which signaled to Palestinian leaders that violence and intransigence had no costs, and so hindered the cause of peace. Today, Palestinian leaders still refuse to recognize Israel as a Jewish State, still incite and financially reward terrorism, and still lash out against our lawmakers and diplomats. Thirty years ago, Congress correctly declared that the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and its affiliates were terror groups who had no place keeping an office in the United States.

Rightly known as the ‘Gateway to the Air Force,’ Lackland equips our Airmen to defend our freedoms and project American strength abroad. Great to visit @usairforce servicemen & women at Lackland Air Force Base today! There, I received a briefing on training operations, toured training facilities & discussed challenges that the brave men & women who wear our country's uniform encounter. #TexasDefendsAmerica America must do everything possible to support them, including fully enforcing all American sanctions, and I call upon our allies across the world to do the same. -->   I have long called for withdrawing from this dysfunctional deal & targeting the regime w the sanctions surrendered by the Obama admin. The protests intensifying across Iran right now show us yet again that the Iranian people yearn to throw off the yoke of an oppressive regime.

The deal was designed to allow the Ayatollahs to cheat while flooding them with billions to be used for terrorism and repression.

The Senate has once again fulfilled our 1st responsibility: equipping our military & ensuring the defense of this nation.

Grateful for Rep. Scalise’s leadership in the House, and I urge the Supreme Court to defend the religious liberty of every American. -->   The American Humanist Association convinced the Fourth Circuit to adopt a perverse interpretation of the Establishment Clause, which in no way prohibits a war memorial on public land from featuring religious imagery. Erected in the aftermath of World War I, the Peace Cross has stood as a testament to the courage and sacrifice of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. The Fourth Circuit agreed, failing to recognize the history and context of the memorial and misinterpreting the Constitution. For 90 years, the families of Prince George’s County have honored America’s fallen heroes. In the aftermath of World War I, residents in Prince George’s County erected a 40-foot Peace Cross to honor nearly 50 local men who lost their lives in the conflict. In 2014, the American Humanist Association brought a suit claiming the cross violated the Establishment Clause.

We can enforce the law and keep families together at the Southern border with the Protect Kids and Parents Act introduced by @SenTedCruz — the bill would expedite hearings as well as double the number of immigration judges.pic.twitter.com/qCUej8wpdv I am disappointed the Senate failed today to pass the President’s $15 billion spending cut package. This is a small, but critical, first step to rein in wasteful government spending and provide relief from our nation's crippling debt. Grateful for my Republican colleagues' support for the Protect Kids & Parents Act. Together we are working on legislation that focuses on solving the problem of kids being separated from their parents at the border.pic.twitter.com/fpbTl6ZGkI It claims to be objective, but spends time & resources attacking Israel while ignoring the crimes of terrorist groups. Participation in the UNHRC did nothing to advance US national security interests. I've long called for ending participation & commend the Admin for its decision. The United States has been legitimizing the thugs & autocrats on the United Nations Human Rights Council for too long. This is a body that claims to sit in judgment about human rights, but includes human rights abusers such as Venezuela, China & Cuba. -->   Congratulations to the 7th Bomb Wing of the @usairforce for being awarded the Outstanding Unit Award for the sixth time by @AFGlobalStrike!

America can be a nation of laws while still being a nation of compassion. Now is the time to act.pic.twitter.com/piEtaQ06S9 Learn more about this important legislation here: … I’m taking action to stop the separation of parents and children at the border by cosponsoring @SenTedCruz’s Protect Kids and Parents Act. We need to fix our broken immigration laws but we don’t have to separate parents and children to do so. I am co-sponsoring @SenTedCruz Protect Kids and Family Act because I believe that we can, and should, treat children and families in our immigration system with compassion, while enforcing our nation’s immigration laws. Read the text of the bill here -->   It also doubles the number of immigration judges and expedites the process by which we handle asylum claims by families who enter our country. I hope that my Democratic colleagues can join with us to stop the crisis that is occurring at the border. -->   We can come together to fix this problem. The Protect Kids and Parents Act focuses on solving the current problem: it stops family separation, except in situations where it is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the child. Over the past few weeks, Americans have been rightly horrified by the images and videos coming from our southern border, where tearful children are being pulled away from their mothers and fathers. There is no doubt that this must stop, immediately.pic.twitter.com/Oa0VCgE2y2 ICYMI at @senjudiciary: "It is not possible, logically, for Director Comey to tell us the truth, and for Director McCabe to be telling the truth. Which one is telling the truth to the best of your knowledge?"   Watch my full Q&A here -->  pic.twitter.com/Si5jmMG9DK With this passage, we take another step towards supporting our military, enhancing its readiness & providing the capabilities our military needs. In today’s challenging threat environment, a strong military is vital to preserving our national security, prosperity & way of life. Additionally, the Senate bill authorizes another well-deserved pay raise for America’s men and women in uniform. I am proud of the work we accomplished for our nation in this year's NDAA. #FY19NDAA The #FY19NDAA provides a clear framework for rebuilding and strengthening our military. In support of the National Defense Strategy, this legislation prioritizes the development of strategic capabilities while maintaining the strength of the force. -->   On this day in 1865, General Gordon Granger rode into #Galveston, Texas & delivered a proclamation that continues to ring loud & clear throughout the course of our nation's history to the present: the abolishment of slavery and emancipation for all. #Juneteenth #FreedomDay … My legislation will fix the backlog in immigration cases, remove legal barriers to swift processing, and resolve asylum cases on an expedited basis. And I urge my Democratic colleagues to join me to work to solve this problem.pic.twitter.com/VzYRww54NL "This has to stop," Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said when asked about the separation of migrant families at the border in his state.   He'll also be introducing legislation "that will mandate that kids must stay with their parents."pic.twitter.com/2j0Z515d88 “A great advantage of this #rescissions package is that Democrats are unable to filibuster it, and if Republicans stand together, we can start cutting back on unnecessary spending & provide much needed fiscal sanity to our country.” #fiscalsanitypic.twitter.com/LEHRqyKYYg LIVE now!pic.twitter.com/0XZULhn0vo This morning ~10:30am CT, I will be joining @SenMikeLee in a press conference urging the Senate to vote on the Spending Cuts to Expired & Unnecessary Programs Act to take action against our nation's crippling debt. Watch my live remarks here —>   Sen. Ted Cruz introduces 'emergency' bill to keep immigrant families together, slams Dems' proposal   #FoxNews We can fix this. If my Democratic colleagues will join me, not play politics but work to solve the problem, we can start to end family separation this week. And, we can honor the rule of law. While cases are pending, families should stay together.Children belong w their families.Once their cases have been adjudicated–under my bill, in no longer than 14 days–those who meet the standard should be granted asylum & those who don’t should be returned to their home country. The answer isn't what congressional Dems are proposing: releasing illegal aliens & returning to the failed policy of ‘catch & release.’ Rather, we must fix the backlog in immigration cases, remove legal barriers to swift processing & resolve asylum cases on an expedited basis. I've visited detention facilities tragically housing children. For too long, they've been victims of our broken immigration system, detained under the Obama Administration & through the present, facing horrific physical or sexual assault from human traffickers. All Americans are rightly horrified by the images we are seeing on the news, children in tears pulled away from their mothers and fathers. This must stop. Now. We can end this crisis by passing the legislation I am introducing this week. -->   .@AstroPeggy is a national treasure. 1st woman to serve as chief of the astronaut corps, first female commander of @Space_Station & she has spent more time in space than any American. Thank you for your remarkable service to our country & congrats on a well-deserved retirement. … We are continuing to rebuild, and I know that we’ll come out of this stronger than before because the Texas spirit of determination, generosity, and strength will guide us forward. -->   I am inspired by the incredible resiliency that our teachers and students displayed in the wake of Harvey’s destruction. Committed to our children’s education, Texas communities stood together and our students finished the school year strong. Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc along Texas' Gulf Coast, leaving many students, families & teachers without a home, a place to work, or even a place to go to school. But Texans are not easily knocked down. As we all prepare for summer break & I look back on the past school year. I’m rooting for @SteveScalise & my fellow GOP’ers as they take the field tonight!

Glad to have you back, Steve. #CBG18 … I remain committed to working hard for the servicemen and women of Texas, and to ensure our country’s national security threats are addressed. #NDAA #FY19NDAA -->   I am proud of the great work we accomplished during the Senate Armed Services Committee’s markup, yet there remain crucial gaps that need to be filled in order for TX’ military communities to be well positioned for the future & to confront our national security challenges abroad. One of the most important obligations of Congress is to ensure our military is properly equipped and funded to protect and serve our country, and the #NDAA provides us with the opportunity to do that. Three of these amendments directly benefit Texas & its military and space competitiveness efforts, while the remaining four amendments aim to strengthen the United States’ national security interests abroad. Recently I filed seven amendments to the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (#NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019, in efforts to strengthen Texas’ military and space competitiveness and address national security threats abroad. #FY19NDAA Happy #FlagDay, America.

The office was allowed to remain open as long as the Palestinians did not leverage international institutions like the ICC against Israel but instead pursued peace. It is well past time to close it. The Palestinians have encouraged the International Criminal Court (ICC) to launch a baseless and illegitimate investigation against Israel, which is unacceptable and underlines why Congress long ago prohibited the PLO office in Washington DC. They have also turned that hostility against the United States, condemning President Trump, Vice President Pence, Ambassador Haley, and other American officials who stood with Israel and against terrorism. The Palestinian leadership has shown relentless & unrepentant hostility toward our close ally Israel. They have refused to recognize Israel as a Jewish State & directly incentivized terrorism by providing hundreds of millions in salaries & benefits to terrorists & their families. Proud to pen letter w @RosLehtinen to Secretary of State Pompeo and Attorney General Sessions urging the Administration to take the necessary steps and instituting the necessary legal action to close the Palestine Liberation Organization’s (PLO) office.-->   We cannot turn a blind eye to continuing unnecessary spending and driving our nation further into debt.

Watch here-->   This is a welcome first step to end Ortega’s regime and give hope to Nicaraguans and freedom-loving people everywhere. -->   I commend @SecPompeo for today’s announcement to impose visa restrictions on individuals responsible for human rights abuses and undermining democracy in Nicaragua. Francisco Diaz, a leader of Nicaragua’s National Police, should also be targeted for committing serious human rights abuses, including possible complicity in the killing of over 100 peaceful protesters, and sanctioned if found responsible. The Administration imposed sanctions on Rivas by the end of that month. Congress is now again urging the Administration to take action against Lopez for systemic corruption, which fuels the Ortega regime and undermines the democratic will of the Nicaraguan people. In December, I joined my colleagues to urge the Administration to invoke the Global Magnitsky Act & designate Roberto Rivas, President of the Supreme Electoral Council & Francisco Lopez, VP of ALBANISA, a tool of the Venezuelan regime that doles out oil to its puppets & allies.

We need to understand where things have gone wrong. @EliLake on my new amendment: "One lawmaker demanding accountability is Cruz" -->  Such measures must be the beginning of an unceasing push to hold oppressors accountable. I'm proud to intro this bill, which would require the US government to name the names of those in the Chinese Communist Party who are wrongfully imprisoning men and women like Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, and to sanction them for their human rights abuses. -->   Today, Liu Xia & thousands of political prisoners continue to suffer under Communist tyranny. We must stand w the men & women who continue to fight for liberty in China, both to honor the legacy of those who died in the fight & to elevate the cause of those who continue fighting. Twenty-nine years ago, today, students and professors in China peacefully gathered in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, calling on the Communist regime to end its oppressive rule over the Chinese people.
