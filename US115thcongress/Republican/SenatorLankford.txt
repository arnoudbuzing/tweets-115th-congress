President Erdogan has unjustly held an American, Dr. Andrew Brunson, in a Turkish prison for almost two years. Erdogan does NOT do things the right way and should be confronted – not commended – for his actions. … I trust the assessments of Dan Coats, Gina Haspel & their teams more than I trust a former KGB agent, Vladimir Putin. U.S. Presidents should meet w/ foreign leaders. But we must unequivocally denounce Russia’s election interference attempts & human rights abuses around the world. The latest Special Counsel indictments are another reminder about our election vulnerabilities. The next election is only a little more than 16 weeks away.

It’s no coincidence that prosperous and free countries also have a free press.   Praying for the victims at the Capital Gazette, their families, & the Annapolis community. The greatest challenge facing our #Oklahoma #farmers and Ag community is trade and rapid fluctuations in commodity prices. Programs in the Farm Bill can't make up for the harm that can be inflicted by trade actions that jeopardize our global markets.   … I strongly support the important work of our #farmers and ranchers in #Oklahoma. The Farm Bill has a nice-sounding name — the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 — but the bill doesn’t make real improvements and reforms to our federal agriculture policy.   Some are calling for the Senate to delay confirmation of a new Supreme Court Justice until after this year’s election, claiming some election year precedent. That precedent pertains to a presidential election, not a midterm election.

I also look forward to the President’s nominee coming before the Senate in the next few months, and confirming a qualified nominee to the bench this Fall.   Congress has got to learn how to focus on solving the issue of #immigration rather than just complaining about it.

In America, everyone has the right to speak their own mind or choose to be silent, but people don't have to say what the gov't tries to compel them to say.  #GiveFreeSpeechLife Watch this. It shows the difficult job of our border law enforcement officials. As they try to prevent drugs & violent people from getting in to the country & also help those in need of asylum, Congress must do their job & legislate to allow detained families to stay together. … Last night’s Senate-passed Appropriations bill is good news for #Oklahoma. It funds construction & renovation at the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center. It also has funding to bring the KC-46A Tanker to the Altus Air Force Base. … Over the weekend I spoke with @SenatorLankford about the #visa process, #ImmigrantChildren, #reunification, and the financial & economic impacts of #Immigration. #Jobs #Employment  America.....  The key is not uniform policy views; it is uniform respect for each other and the process. It is disagreement without personal attack. #civility … Unity and respect do not require watered-down policy positions and weakness. They require respect for views that are different, and understanding that the people that disagree do not want to destroy the country. Maybe they just have a different view of the world. #civility … If the national pendulum is ever going to swing, it will require role models in every community who don’t just call out for respectful opposition, but practice it. #civility … A year ago, Washington joined in unity, prayer and civility after horror erupted on a baseball field. We should be able to disagree without being disagreeable. #civility … "The best thing we can do is try to reform it, so we can keep families together... and get through a proper hearing," @senatorlankford says on changing the Flores ruling. #MTP WATCH: @SenatorLankford says "We know where every child is," on the process of reuniting families. #MTP  EXCLUSIVE: Sen.

It is worth 15 minutes of your time. … Our #immigration system is badly broken. One of its many problems is that one Administration has flexibility to change prosecutorial discretion any time it wants. Congress should not only fix family separation, we must fix #DACA, border security, asylum process, & other issues.pic.twitter.com/JOOWxApR8h Today is Juneteenth, a day that recognizes the June 19, 1865 announcement of the abolition of slavery.

Our bill creates a government-wide approach to solving supply chain security issues in federal acquisitions. … Glad the Senate today completed one of our primary responsibilities - supporting America’s national defense & passing the #NDAA. It improves our military and supports the women and men who provide our security.   A bill I co-sponsored, the Secure & Succeed Act, would have repealed this Flores policy, so we can keep   #KeepFamiliesTogether. The administration can tweak this. But it is also past time for Congress to reform our broken immigration laws   … A 1997 court settlement called Flores v. Reno prevents the gov’t from keeping children with their parents if the parents are charged with a crime for crossing the border illegally. The law doesn't have to be enforced this way due to prosecutorial discretion. I disagree with the administration’s policy of separating families, but we must continue to protect the privacy of the children, many who have experienced trauma. #KeepFamiliesTogether & keep cameras away from these kids.

Sadly, this will continue to be the norm unless we reform our budget process.   Check out my @NRO op-ed with @PursuitHQ’s Dr. Tom Coburn → … I’m grateful for the veterans who served our nation in Vietnam. We will not forget the 58,000 Americans who gave their lives for our country. #VietnamWarVeteransDay  Happy birthday to Oklahoma's most famous & powerful redhead, Reba McEntire.

I could not support this massive bill nor the broken budget process that brought us this bill.   As we consider this #Omnibus, remember:  o Fiscal Year ended Sept. 30, 2017, nearly 6 months ago!  o We’ve passed 5 Continuing Resolutions o National debt is $21 trillion o 2018 deficit could top $1 trillion o This bill is $1.3 trillion & 2,300 pages  This is no way to govern...

Graham’s last time in the Sooner State. @NewsOK  Russian troll farms are using the Parkland shooting & gun debate to create more division in America. They do things like this in various nations to try to destabilize institutions & create societal chaos & doubt in gov’ts. … Glad to hear the administration talking about debt & deficit.   I’m still disappointed that Congress just raised the debt ceiling (again) without discussing reform for the drivers of our deficit. #FederalFumbles … Billy Graham was one of the greatest spiritual and moral leaders in America’s history.

We must not forget them; nor should we relent in pressing for their immediate release. Pleased to see Russian indictments & hope we continue to seek justice for their attack on our democracy. Russia has tried to influence U.S. policy decisions & are still trying. They meddle in multiple nations because they believe they benefit from discord & loss of trust in gov't It’s clear that Russia meddled in our 2016 election. @amyklobuchar @SenatorCollins @SenKamalaHarris & I have a bill to strengthen election cybersecurity. Former DHS Sec. Chertoff & @GroverNorquist have highlighted the #SecureElectionsAct as solution. … Very disappointed we failed to pass immigration legislation this wk. This was a unique opportunity to protect #Dreamers & secure borders. It’s also disappointing that Dems would't consider our bill simply because the Pres. supported it. Immigration is hard, but we can't give up. The Schumer-Rounds-Collins plan is well-meaning but has serious flaws. For example on pg 64, it says our immigration laws should not be enforced for any new illegal aliens who are here or who entered the U.S. in the next 4 months, until June 30, until they commit a serious crime.pic.twitter.com/BYLzwW7VEX The immigration challenges facing our nation have been left unaddressed for far too long, and it is clear to me that the best opportunity for a result – for a bill to become law – is through the Secure and Succeed Act. Full statement:   Schumer-Rounds-Collins is well-intentioned but falls drastically short of being a proposal that can get a vote in the House and be signed into law. The Senate needs to learn from the Gang of 8 failure, not repeat it. Only 1 proposal punishes human traffickers & better prevents terrorism. The Grassley proposal is already a major compromise with the W.H. on the wall & citizenship for #Dreamers. We should focus on the Grassley plan for national security & certainty for immigrant families. (2/2) Of the Immigration proposals receiving a vote in the Senate today, only one can pass the House & be signed into law by the President. The Schumer-Rounds-Collins proposal fails to adequately secure the border and improve our nation’s immigration system.

There is no evidence that Russia changed the 2016 outcome, but it's clear their meddling has contributed to more division The vast majority of our 35,000 FBI officials work very hard to keep us safe – most Americans will never see or know these heroes.

In addition to touting #TaxReform & growing economy, he highlighted the power of everyday people who changed the world by serving others. I also appreciate his call for Congress to embrace unity.   I’ve always wanted to visit the Buffalo Wild Wings in Enid, Oklahoma with owner Ed Lynn. This counts, right?

My bill w @SenatorLankford would help improve election security & protect the future of our democracy. … The right for people of ALL faiths & ethnicities to peacefully live should be a global human right. On International #HolocaustRemembranceDay #weremember all the innocent Jews who were oppressed and killed.   We must never forget this atrocity. Service in the military is not just an individual sacrifice, it is a family sacrifice. Thanks to all the military spouses in #Oklahoma and around the nation. #NationalSpousesDay … STRONGLY support WH plan protecting nuclear family & giving preference to spouses & children in immigration. Also trust fund for border security/Wall. This is a great plan. Two weeks ago, a bipartisan group in Congress agreed with the President to enact immigration reform addressing four main topics. After reviewing proposals from Republicans & Democrats, POTUS today released a common-sense compromise. Now it’s time for Congress to get to work. The Dream Act has come up 3x’s in Congress in the last decade. It has failed every time, including when Dems controlled WH & Congress.  To those who are truly serious about finding a DACA solution, it’s time to move past the Dream Act & discuss other options. We only have 14 days There are only 7 countries left that still permit elective abortion after 20 weeks—including the US, China, and North Korea. That’s why the #Senate will soon vote to take up commonsense legislation to protect unborn children who can feel pain. Encouraged to see the White House framework for Dreamers. I’m especially glad it outlines a path to citizenship. This is a good starting point for Congress to get to work and pass a permanent solution. My statement on the White House #immigration framework. Congress needs to get this done for the good of our nation.pic.twitter.com/qZ65jfXT5L The White House framework is something that both Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate should be eager to support. We all want a good deal, and here it is. #gapol JUST IN: #Trump immigration proposal could provide path to citizenship for 1.8 million in US illegally  We cannot fix what we cannot see. I put out #FederalFumbles every year so we can clearly see the ways we are wasting or inefficiently spending taxpayer dollars. I encourage every single Member of Congress to join me. … America must stand w/ Yezidis, Coptic Christians, Muslims, & other religious minorities who are persecuted in nations like in Iraq, Syria, China, & Burma. Sam Brownback will do a fantastic job leading our efforts as Ambassador of Int’l #ReligiousFreedom.   It’s past time for Congress to seriously address the immigration problems that have plagued our nation for decades. Recognition of the human dignity of all people and the immigration security of our nation are not mutually exclusive; we can and must do both. I appreciate that POTUS is taking a leadership role in developing a permanent solution for DACA, border security & immigration issues. After the framework release, Congress must engage in honest debate focused on solutions, not grandstanding & partisanship … .@TomCoburn and I are talking #governmentwaste & #FederalFumbles with @PursuitHQ.

Once the government reopens those conversations can and will speed up. But it is imperative that Congress comes together to find solutions in a way that doesn’t jeopardize military, children’s healthcare, and important gov’t functions. UPDATE: Gov’t shutdown will continue into Day 3. Senate will vote on a CR to reopen the gov’t midday Monday. Responsible governing requires working together & finding common ground. There are substantive immigration conversations happening that will solve DACA & border issues. In 2013, Mr. Schumer said, “I believe in immigration reform. What if I persuaded my caucus to shut the gov’t down.. unless I get my way? It's a politics of idiocy..”  I agree. Let’s end this shutdown, pass a CR & continue working on DACA & border security. … The gov’t is shut down (needlessly, I might add). But me & our staff are working for Oklahoma. Thank goodness @sonicdrivein never shuts down. Hope @SenSchumer comes around & joins us in reopening the gov’t.

My Universal #CharitableGiving Act creates a universal deduction. More HERE:  … Relisting #NorthKorea as a State Sponsor of Terrorism is a good decision. Kim Jong-un is threatening the world w/ nuclear & missile threats, while his own people go w/o basic necessities. We must use all diplomatic measures to redirect this dangerous regime. Seeing a lot of comments today about the #AdoptionTaxCredit. FYI... it actually IS included in the Senate #TaxReform bill AND the House bill that passed on Thurs.  … On this #NatlAdoptionDay, we celebrate #adoption. However, there are 110,000 kids in #fostercare who need a forever family. Visit   &   to learn more. The Man. The Myth. The Mountain. Happy birthday @jiminhofe! I applaud @AjitPaiFCC & the #FCC for reforming the Tribal #Lifeline program to reduce fraud & waste, making it more efficient for those who truly need it in #Oklahoma.   The #NDAA has passed the Senate & is headed to POTUS's desk. This critical bill enhances military readiness & continues to provide resources & training necessary for the safety, security, & reliability of those that selflessly protect our nation. You're doing fine, Oklahoma! 110 years ago Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Happy Statehood Day!pic.twitter.com/1JedcQA1jk Republican @SenatorLankford says "we need to be able to maintain very open free trade"  pic.twitter.com/wFXLg22AeF Improving trade agreements is a good thing. Our Trade Rep should prioritize job creation over trade deficits & avoid ‘sunset’ clauses in new agreements. #NAFTA … We have to get the economy growing again, but we have to deal w/ half a trillion dollars in overspending too. We can do both. #TaxReformpic.twitter.com/aJBozzRiai The Obamacare individual mandate tax should be repealed because it hurts people who can’t afford it. Repealing it through #TaxReform would not take away the subsidies for people, just the mandate tax. #MorningJoepic.twitter.com/GHhruzHWpM I’m sad for the victims and the people of Alabama going through this. But it's good that the nation is talking about moral issues & trying to hold leaders to a higher account. Harassment in Hollywood, Capitol Hill, media, or anywhere is unacceptable. #MorningJoepic.twitter.com/CspcZzzsN7 TUNE IN: Joining @msnbc #MorningJoe at 7:20am ET / 6:20am CT I joined @USCIRF today to discuss #Turkey & their disrespect for #HumanRights.

Thank you for your service & sacrifice. #SemperFi #HappyBirthdayMarinespic.twitter.com/L3kygAyXyt In the last 10yrs, economic growth has averaged under 2%. This is unacceptable.

Douglas Williams at 7:40am CT. Honored to #StandWithNurses today. Congress should pass the #ConscienceProtectionAct to protect health care providers from gov’t discrimination if they decline to participate in abortions. This should not be controversial.pic.twitter.com/QtahpW4XG9 The goal of health care is to heal and not kill. Congress must #StandWithNurses, like Cathy, and pass the Conscience Protection Act.pic.twitter.com/qOWFFzbmE5 The most decorated American Indian Soldier, Poolaw considered his job  more important than his own life.
