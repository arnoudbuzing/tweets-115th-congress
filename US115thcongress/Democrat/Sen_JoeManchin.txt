Service to our country, our community, our neighbors and our families. Today we come together to reflect on that horrific day and remember the lives we lost. It is also important to remember the American spirit that prevailed in the face of such tragedy. Seventeen years ago our country was attacked in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on #September11th. Our first responders bravely ran in to the flames and our country joined the mothers, fathers and children who wept for their loved ones lost.

Nearly 800,000 West Virginians and 1.8 million Kentuckians’ lives depend on it. This is not a Democratic or Republican issue, this is life or death to many. I refuse to sit idly by while West Virginia’s own Attorney General tries to allow insurance companies to play God by deciding who they will and will not insure. This cruel lawsuit would put nearly 800,000 West Virginians at risk of financial ruin if they’ve been identified to have a pre-existing condition. We had a bipartisan agreement to vote but yet again Mitch McConnell chose to play politics with the healthcare of millions of Americans, 1.8 million of them in his home state of Kentucky. What’s happening today in the Senate is disgusting. Once again, Mitch McConnell is letting politics determine the work of the Senate by refusing to allow the Senate to vote on my common sense amendment to protect healthcare access for those with pre-existing conditions.pic.twitter.com/mXgVTschTb We have an opportunity today to stand up for the millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions that are trusting us to protect their healthcare access. It’s just common sense and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this resolution.

Thanks to everyone who joined me today for this important discussion! "The Declaration of Independence says all men are created equal. It doesn't say unless you have a pre-existing condition." - Dr. Dawn Jones, Shenandoah Community Health Center "Senator - what you've described over the last hour is it doesn't have to be either or. It's not a sound economy with sick people or a healthy population but we're broke. We just need to use common sense to find solutions." - Pastor Joey Rainey, Covenant Church Shepherdstown "Everyone - whether they like it or not is going to be affected. The economic impact of a repeal will be felt in every aspect of our society. I've heard from over 8,000 West Virginians about the impact will have on their lives." - @Sen_JoeManchin "We all agree that the ACA needs to be tweaked. There is room for it to be improved and repaired." - @Sen_JoeManchin "It's common sense. If you're sick, you go to the doctor. You don't go to the E.R. for a headache. But people need access to the doctor first." - George Blough, cancer survivor "Unfunded care costs all of us. As a chaplain I get called to the E.R. often and many of the patients don't have money to pay those medical bills. Those costs get past on. The ACA isn't perfect, but it's the beginning." - Pastor Eddie Edmonds, Moler Ave. Church of the Brothren "I have about 6 pre-existing conditions and without insurance I'd be in a jam. The Affordable Care Act has changed my life." - JoAnn, client at Shenandoah Community Health Center "If those with substance abuse disorder are cut off from healthcare access, we will see the opioid epidemic in West Virginia get exponentially worse. People need ongoing access to healthcare because recovery is an ongoing process." - Dave Didden, Jefferson Co. Health Dept. "I've worked with low income populations for years. The ramifications of not having healthcare are wide. They can't work, they can't get housing because they are bankrupt from their medical bills. It affects every access of their life." Michelle Goldman, nurse at free clinic "I can't believe people are so set on repealing this access without a replacement plan in place. We can't go back to a time when one illness could mean financial ruin for a family in West Virginia." - @Sen_JoeManchin "But for the first time we have people getting treatment for mental illness or substance abuse when they never had it before. People who never had access to health insurance have it now. But we never taught anyone how to use this new access." - @Sen_JoeManchin "Do I think the Affordable Care Act is everything it should be? No. And I have said that. If I had been there in 2009, I would have fought for a better product mix." - @Sen_JoeManchin I'm in Shepherdstown this morning to meet with community members about our concerns about protecting healthcare coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. I'm joined by healthcare providers, cancer survivors and faith leaders for this important discussion. I spent the afternoon in Huntington at the Italian Festival.

I’ll continue fighting side by side with Republicans and Democrats to ensure every WVian has access to the quality healthcare they deserve. Last week, I led a Senate resolution to defend those protections for the 800k WVians with a pre-existing condition.  But instead of bringing these up for a vote, Republicans are continuing to chip away at WVians access to healthcare. #WV’s own AG is leading a lawsuit to eliminate protections for those with pre-exisiting conditions.

It’s also why I strongly opposed the @FCC’s decision to repeal basic #NetNeutrality protections & cosponsored the bill to keep them in place that passed that Senate with bipartisan support last month. It’s why WVians have told me that they want an internet that is free of content-based discrimination & support increased reliable, affordable internet access throughout our state. I am disappointed that #NetNeutrality protections for all Americans will end today. Like West Virginians, the internet has always been & should always be free. Once the bill is passed by the House & Senate and signed by the President, @Amtrak will have to reinstate a position in the state. I will keep fighting to keep and grow jobs in #WV, even if I have to go one at a time.

Chief Dial has been serving the people of Huntington for more than half his life & he will make an exceptional police chief.

It’s unacceptable & the House should be ashamed that they are denying a World War II hero, Medal of Honor recipient & Gold Star Families’ advocate this great honor. It only took four months to pass the resolution in the Senate & it’s been sitting in the House ever since & no one can give me a reason why. This is one of the many reasons why people hate Washington. It is only fitting that a #WV VA Medical Center be named to honor the service & sacrifice of Medal of Honor recipient & WV icon, @WoodyWilliams45. That’s why I condemn the House of Representatives for not passing my resolution to rename the Huntington VA Medical Center after him. I sent letters to HHS Secretary Azar & EPA Regional Adminstrator Servidio asking them to provide additional resources to Minden, conduct more research into the link between PCBs & cancer, & visit Minden #WV to learn first hand.

I hope an agreement can be reached today to send our kids back to school.pic.twitter.com/tLBD7NCO8S I urge the Senate Republican leadership to stop playing games and send our kids back to school. Sadly, just like in Washington, it looks like political gamesmanship is winning the day & preventing a bipartisan compromise led by the Governor to help our educators & public employees, fix our PEIA system & get students learning again from becoming law. But for some reason, Senate Republicans are choosing to keep our schools closed & kids at home over one percent. #WV families deserve better. When I visited with educators two weeks ago at the state capitol, they told me they want to be back in their classrooms. It's time to get our kids back to school, & the only group standing in the way is Senate Republicans. Everyone else agrees on the deal to reopen our schools - a bipartisan coalition of educators, parents, Democrat & Republican Legislators, & the Governor. Today I intro'd a bill that will restore @DEAHQ's authority to go after pharmaceutical companies that are violating the law & flooding #WV communities with opioids.

I appreciate your participation & it helps me take the common sense we need back to Washington!pic.twitter.com/n6mGr4krga The President called me last week & invited me to the White House to talk about ways we can work together on immigration reform. So for Mike Pence to come in yesterday & start firing shots is not leadership. I’d simply urge Mr. Pence to show better leadership qualities. My record speaks for itself. If they’re attacking people like me then they don't want bipartisanship. They are not committed or sincere about making government work. I've voted 54% of the time with the Trump Administration when I think it’s what’s best for #WV. There isn’t another person in Congress who votes as bipartisan as I do. They also wanted to kill healthcare access for 200k West Virginians & bankrupt our #WV hospitals. I cosponsored 2 bipartisan bills that would prevent this. Again, they chose to be partisan. Mike Pence talks a good game as far as bipartisanship but I met with their team 21 times to make tax cuts larger & permanent for the middle class, not big businesses and millionaires. They decided to be strictly partisan instead of helping the middle class West Virginians. .@Sen_JoeManchin joins @HoppyKercheval to address the @VP’s comments about him. WATCH:  pic.twitter.com/d3RvIlZt1g The VP’s comments are exactly why Washington Sucks. I’m disappointed in his comments but will continue to work to make Washington work so #WV & our country work. Last week, I worked in a bipartisan way with Senator Collins to end the shutdown, & last night President Trump called for unity & bipartisanship. I am shocked that after the @VP worked for almost a year in a divisive & partisan way to take healthcare away from almost 200k WVians, bankrupt our hospitals & push tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans & huge corporations that he would come to #WV & continue partisan attacks.

This #shutdown is ridiculous - plain & simple.pic.twitter.com/6W6yU1MxLW – bei United States Capitol Building If Congress can’t come together to fulfill one of our most basic constitutional obligations, then we don’t deserve to get paid either. Yesterday I intro'd legislation to withhold Congress' pay during a government #shutdown  Governing this way is dangerous for our country & I'm doing everything I can to ensure this #shutdown ends swiftly. Do you have questions about how this shutdown will impact you & your family in #WV? This Q&A may be helpful.  We must come together to do our job, & find a solution to reopen the government as soon as possible. I will work around the clock in order to get that done. Funding the government is one of our most basic constitutional obligations & now because of partisan politics, the government will shut down. Governing this way is dangerous to our national security and embarrassing for both political parties. West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin introduced legislation today that would withhold pay from members of Congress if they are unable to prevent a government shutdown.   What do you think of this proposal? … Governing this way is dangerous to our national security & embarrassing for both political parties. I urge my colleagues to come together, do our job, & find a solution that keeps our government running. I’m prepared to stay here as long as it takes to get that done. Funding the government is one of our most basic constitutional obligations. We cannot keep kicking the can down the road just to face the same problems a month later. We have important work to do including ensuring our military is equipped to protect our country, fighting the opioid epidemic, keeping our promise to miners so they don’t lose their pensions, funding #CHIP & CHC's, expanding broadband access & passing an infrastructure package. We are already more than 3 months in to FY 2018 & we still don’t have a plan to fund our government. Every time we pass short-term funding, we put our national security at risk, we stall critical projects & throw our economy & our citizens into limb. Today, I will vote to keep the government open for a fourth time for FY2018 through a continuing resolution. Just because I will vote to pass this doesn’t mean I like it. I have never & will never vote to shutdown the government. In December a #WV Veteran contacted my office because his surgery at the Clarksburg VA was halted due to spots on the tools processed by the hospital's autoclave.

I'm not going to sit idly by while millions of Americans continue to die. As a nation, we cannot accept this anymore. We need to commit to passing my legislation, the LifeBOAT Act, which would creating a permanent funding stream by placing a one cent fee on every milligram of opioid produced. This would bring in about $2 billion a year.  If we are serious about fixing this problem, we need targeted emergency funding to save lives now & permanent funding for treatment centers that can save lives tomorrow. For too long, we have focused on Band-Aid solutions as this crisis has compounded into too many societal issues to count. But despite the impacts we continue to do far too little to stop it. What we are doing is not working. It is clear we must double, triple or quadruple our efforts. We all know about the trauma our neighbors, families & friends have endured as a result of this epidemic. We know about the strain it has put on our communities. Despite my best efforts to work with Congressional leadership & 2 administrations for nearly a decade, our country still cannot properly combat an epidemic that is ravaging our nation & that will change every aspect of our society for generations to come. That is a 28% increase from 2015. That is 115 people dying every single day. Today the @CDCgov released a new report on opioid related overdose deaths & it's devastating. 42,249 Americans died from an opioid overdose death in 2016.   I'm pleased @realDonaldTrump has issued an executive order to identify new sources of critical minerals - or rare earth elements - in the US.
