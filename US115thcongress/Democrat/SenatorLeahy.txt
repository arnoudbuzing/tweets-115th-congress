The National Sexual Assault Hotline has seen a 57 percent uptick in calls since Dr Ford went public. How the Senate handles allegations against Brett Kavanaugh sends a message to survivors about how their allegations will be received if they take the brave step of coming forward. The idea that the United States Senate, and the Senate Judiciary Committee, would refuse to hear from these women, before confirming Judge Kavanaugh to the highest court in the land, for a lifetime, is unconscionable. President Trump said late today: “They're giving the women a major chance to speak.” But we’re ONLY, briefly, hearing from Dr. Ford. There are other credible allegations, & victims are willing to testify. The Senate needs to hear from them for this process to have credibility. Proud to be an original cosponsor of Senator Udall’s bill. Other Udalls, through our recent history, would also be proud of this. … On Wednesday, after a third woman accused U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, Sen.

But one with a cruel twist: they are prosecuting the victim instead of the alleged perpetrator. “Plow right through.” That’s what Republican leaders want to do with Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination, even though serious and credible allegations of sexual misconduct have been brought forward. Republicans want to rush this vote through ASAP.pic.twitter.com/2WQ2wYzZkt For Republicans to schedule a Friday vote on Kavanaugh today, 2 days before Dr. Blasey Ford has had a chance to tell her story, is outrageous. First Republicans demanded Dr. Blasey Ford testify immediately. Now they don’t even need to hear her before they move ahead with a vote. Absolutely Jeff. Our bipartisan bill was passed by the Judiciary Committee, but Republican leaders won’t allow the Senate to debate and vote on it. The need to do that is increasingly urgent. … As former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I would never schedule a vote before we hear critical testimony that speaks to a nominee's fitness for SCOTUS, for a lifetime appt.

She worked for 14 years with the Senate Judiciary Committee as then-Chairman @SenatorLeahy’s top legal and policy advisor - so she has some thoughts about Kavanaugh. For those insisting GOP senators take Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations against Bret Kavanaugh seriously, their claim that their timeline is quasi-sacred is infuriating. A lifetime appointment is at stake. Whose interests are served by haste? My column … President Trump, Dr. Blasey Ford did not want her story of sexual assault to be public. She requested confidentiality and I honored that. It wasn’t until the media outed her that she decided to come forward. You may not respect women and the wishes of victims, but I do. Why is it imperative? Wouldn't the imperative be to see if someone who may be entrusted with a lifetime appointment to the highest court sexually assaulted someone and repeatedly lied about it? … Thanks. Doing all I can.

As of now, Republicans are shaping a process that’s not better, but WORSE, than Hill-Thomas. READ Anita Hill’s insightful advice on lessons learned from that experience: … Exactly. And it’s also critical we get all witnesses on the record and under oath, as Dr. Blasey Ford is willing to do. … And many, many, many other times. Any claim otherwise is nonsense.

FALSE. It's exactly what the FBI does. Until now it’s been a standard bipartisan process to have the FBI investigate new information raised about a nominee. I strongly support efforts to incentivize the purchase of new wood stoves that are cleaner-burning, use less fuel, and reduce energy costs. @EPWDems @EPWGOP @American_Heart @LungAssociation @HPBA_ @veic should make putting new, cleaner stoves in homes a top priority. #VT is one of the top states per capita for primary wood heating & for wood stove emissions. The problem is not new stoves sold today, but older dirtier stoves still in use. The rebate program @SenatorCarper proposed is WHAT WE NEED to help Vermonters upgrade to cleaner stoves. Disappointed that @SenatorCarper’s amendment to create a new Wood Heater Emissions Reductions grant program failed on a party-line vote in @EPWGOP.

The Senate must do better this time.  We have an obligation to the Constitution, to Dr. Ford, to Judge Kavanaugh, and to the American people to get this right. Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination has been a flawed process from the beginning. Republicans have consistently sought to hide his record from the American people. This latest, most serious allegation deserves rigorous scrutiny.  The process must not be rushed through. This is a crucial test for the US Senate.  The integrity of this body, and of our nation’s highest court, is on the line. Dr. Ford has shown incredible courage.

Ahead of their private meeting, Pres. Trump should know that Putin is going to lie to his face.

The Trump Adminstration's purposeful cruel and cynical family separations must end. Vermonters and other Americans standing and speaking out already are making a difference. … Vermonters, with Americans across the nation, know that the Trump family separations are cruel, they are abhorrent, and they violate American ideals. … Thank you, Senator.  I live my life in that zone and it has never been an issue until now. As always, I am proud to have you represent our Brave Little State. I made it clear today in my speech today that I am concerned that anyone who passes Pres. Trump’s litmus tests for judges will not be capable of rising above politics and of providing a check against this admin’s many excesses. @VermontLaw @uvmvermont #vt #restorativejustice I told the @VermontLaw Restorative Justice Conference about the $3m I included in FY 19 funding for a new National Center for Restorative Justice in the Senate markup of Justice Department funding two weeks ago. @uvmvermont #vt #restorativejustice @kylegriffin1 @SenSanders @VermontSOS @MSNBC @SenatorLeahy @ACLU Thanks for introducing this important legislation, Sens Leahy & Murray.

If House Republicans hold either FBI Director Wray or Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein in contempt it would only reveal their utter contempt for the rule of law. … Thanks for checking Patty.

Leahy: Can you give me 1 example of terrorism by a DACA recipient?  Chad Readler of DOJ: No I can't. Leahy: Neither can Jeff Sessions. President Trump should also reflect on Justice Kennedy’s legacy, and select a nominee who will be a fair-minded, independent jurist. It’s past time for the President to represent ALL Americans, not just a favored few. Pres. Trump should listen to the voices of millions of concerned Americans worried that they are on the verge of losing their hard-fought, hard-won rights.  An extreme candidate who would jeopardize the rights of women, minorities and #LGBT Americans is unacceptable. President Trump should use this time to do what President Obama did: Find a mainstream, consensus nominee who would garner broad bipartisan support. That means #DitchTheList. There is no justification for rushing this process. Every Republican embraced the #McConnellStandard last Congress to allow the American people an opportunity to weigh in so close to an election. We can wait now, just as we did then. I did not agree with many of Justice Kennedy’s opinions, but I respected his willingness to recognize the rights of Americans as equals. This legacy is now at risk. My statement on his retirement:  … Some chamber-shade in today's Senate Def-LHHS markup.

Indefinite incarceration of families is NOT the answer. I condemned incarceration of families during the Obama administration and will do so again now.
