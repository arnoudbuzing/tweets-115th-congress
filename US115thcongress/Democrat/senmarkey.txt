I will not take a meeting with Brett Kavanaugh. He has been nominated by someone implicated, and all but named as a co-conspirator, in federal crimes.   His nomination is tainted and should be considered illegitimate. The House just passed the FAA bill, which didn’t include my FAIR Fees provision to rein in exorbitant fees, all because of a ferocious lobbying blitz by the airline industry. The airlines won, and passengers lost. I will oppose any FAA bill that doesn’t put a stop to fee gouging. This rule would force many immigrants to make an impossible choice: forgo your basic needs, or forgo your future in America. Sec. Nielsen saying this will “promote self-sufficiency” is cynical spin on a heartless rule that targets vulnerable communities. … Officer Horgan embodied Boston’s excitement during Papi’s grand slam in the 2013 ALCS.

That’s not a free market, that’s a failed market. Congress shouldn’t miss the opportunity to put an end to this by passing my FAIR Fees provision.  I’m on the Senate floor to express my outrage that Congress is about to miss an historic opportunity to pass my FAIR Fees provision and stop the major airlines from gouging Americans with exorbitant fees every time they fly.

Dozens of homes were damaged or destroyed by the explosions and fires. @ColumbiaGasMA owes immediate and robust financial assistance to those affected so they can begin to recover and rebuild from this disaster. Good news: my bill with @SenMarkey to fund research into a universal flu vaccine has been approved by the Senate. Last year’s flu was the worst we’ve seen in years, and with the next flu season starting soon, we have to be prepared. This is patently false. In 1991, the White House directed the FBI to conduct “a full, thorough, and expeditious investigation” into Anita Hill’s allegations against Clarence Thomas.

We cannot let Senate Republicans rush this nomination and sweep under the rug serious and credible allegations of a sexual assault. Some things matter more than politics. The Senate must allow the FBI to fully investigate Dr. Ford’s allegations against Judge Kavanaugh before a hearing is held. And any additional hearings must include other relevant witnesses. So-called “low-yield” nukes have the potential to lower the threshold for using nuclear weapons and increase the risk of entering the U.S. into nuclear war.

It took tremendous courage for Christine Blasey Ford to come forward. Her allegations against Brett Kavanaugh are credible and must be investigated. The Judiciary Committee should not vote on his nomination this week. The latest from ⁦@NTSB⁩ indicates that alarms went off in a ⁦@ColumbiaGasMA⁩ control room. Were they missed? Ignored?

That’s just plain wrong.  The Trump White House must #ReleaseTheRecords so the American people can judge Brett Kavanaugh for who he really is. #WhatAreTheyHiding? … We’re witnessing a Friday night document massacre. President Trump’s decision to step in at the last moment and hide 100k pages of Judge Kavanaugh’s records from the American public is not only unprecedented in the history of SCOTUS noms, it has all the makings of a cover up. … McConnell warned Trump not to pick #Kavanaugh for #SCOTUS because of his long paper trail. Now the Trump admin is withholding 100,000 documents on the basis of “presidential privilege”.  Every American should demand and deserves to know #WhatAreTheyHiding? … Honored to have attended today’s memorial service for John McCain, a patriot, public servant, and legislator the likes of whom we will never see again. My heart is with the entire McCain family, who have epitomized grace and strength as a nation mourns. “The government is legally required to respond to what it hears from the public.”   The Trump administration is attempting what would be a disastrous rollback of fuel economy emissions standards.

Outside Washington D.C., #NetNeutrality is not a partisan issue. Polling consistently shows the public *overwhelmingly* supports it on a bipartisan basis. With August recess over, it’s time for Congress to get to work to restore #NetNeutrality. In many cities and towns, local papers are the only source of community news. The International Trade Commission made the right call in reversing these harmful tariffs that would have eviscerated local newspapers. … I just reviewed the Kavanaugh documents that Republicans have gone to unprecedented lengths to keep secret.

Brett #Kavanaugh has the fringe idea that internet service providers are entitled to 1st Amendment protection and can block certain content based on their preferences.  The fate of the internet will end up in #SCOTUS and if Kavanaugh is there, he will kill #NetNeutrality forever. #Myanmar’s generals perpetrated atrocities and untold horrors during their genocidal campaign against #Burma’s #Rohingya minority. Trying these generals for war crimes is just the first step in a long process to deliver justice for the Rohingya people. @UN … I will keep my hold on Trump’s nominee for Assistant Secretary of State until he reverses this policy and permanently keeps instructions for making untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons off the internet. Great news that a federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, stopping the Trump administration from allowing blueprints for 3D guns on the internet. But we cannot rely on the courts to keep saving us from Trump. … I am proud of this strong federal investment in Martha’s Vineyard’s economy, and I look forward to continuing the strong local-federal partnership with the region to address critical infrastructure needs. … Courage flowed through John McCain’s veins. It was his lifeblood and our nation was the beneficiary of his strength. A soldier’s courage during war, a legislator’s courage to cross the aisle, a husband and father’s courage to the last.

A better slogan is “Nothing Lies Like The NRA”.   #StopDownloadableGuns And a terrorist organization could make undetectable, downloadable guns from American blueprints to attack American soldiers overseas. Whose side is the NRA on? Downloadable guns are untraceable and will threaten the safety of law enforcement, who won’t have serial numbers to reference. You don’t need a $50,000 3D printer to make a gun. Some cost as little as a few hundred dollars, and the technology is becoming cheaper and better every day. Yes, it’s true prohibited persons are not allowed to own a gun… but that’s exactly why 3D-printable guns are so dangerous. It’s naïve to expect we can prevent prohibited persons like felons from accessing the internet and printing a firearm without a background check. People can print guns with easily removable metal parts – so a metal detector won’t detect them. Democrats tried to close this loophole in 2013, but Republicans refused at the behest of the @NRA. “18 USC 922 G Section O” doesn’t exist. Maybe you meant 18 USC 922 (p), the Undetectable Firearms Act? But it has a serious loophole created by technology like 3D printing.

But his subservience to the NRA is 30 million times stronger than his intuition. #StopDownloadableGuns Remember when Trump said we should raise the age limit for an assault weapon to 21 but then backed down because the NRA spent $30 million for an easily controlled President?

It could mean you are denied coverage or charged unaffordable premiums. Texas & 19 other states are arguing in the courts that the entire ACA must be ruled invalid. The Trump admin refuses to defend it. If the TX judge sides with these states, it means all of the ACA could be struck down, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

A free and open internet is the greatest platform for expression of First Amendment rights. We see whose side #Kavanaugh is really on. Brett #Kavanaugh wrote: “The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility."

SOON: I’ll be on @CNN discussing my recent trip to the border and ICE facilities, #SCOTUS and more. Tune in! One thing became crystal clear after my conversations with those being detained at ICE’s Port Isabel facility: the Trump admin still has literally NO plan or procedures in place for reunifying families. The agencies are as much in the dark as the separated parents themselves. At the ICE facility I visited, I met a woman from Mexico who has lived here for 18 years. She called 911 after her husband brutally beat her. They turned her over to immigration authorities. She now fears deportation. She has 3 kids.  There should be no agency with this mission. .@SenMarkey joins us to discuss his trip over the weekend to the US border: … ICE's activities have become inhumane and brutal. It has turned into a massive deportation army that is experiencing the worst kind of mission creep and strikes fear in the hearts of immigrants who are simply working for a better life.

Trump is only about making America HATE again. The story of this country was written by the hands of immigrants like my grandmother and @SenMarkey’s family. And that created greatness in powerful voices like us. Hear our stories:  pic.twitter.com/M0CR4n5HG3 The clean energy revolution is a blue-collar job revolution. It’s the greatest force for blue-collar job creation in a generation. #ClimateAction Coal is losing because it can’t compete with renewables in the free market – it’s not conspiracy, it’s competition. In 2016, we created as many jobs in #solar energy as exist in the coal industry today – 50,000. #ClimateAction The Republicans have a pretty clear agenda when it comes to #ClimateChange and clean energy: Deny, Delay, and Defund. So my approach is Fight, Fight, and Fight. #ClimateAction If President Trump is waging an assault on clean energy and our climate, then we have to fight back.   We have to fight in Congress, in the courts, and in the streets with grassroots activism. #ClimateAction Starting soon: join me and the nation’s leading climate experts for a summit on one of the greatest crisis of our time: climate change. You can watch live here at 7 PM ET:   Hart Senate Office Building is filled with ferocious and inspiring protestors right now because when families are being torn apart at the border, Americans come together to defend them.

A new #SCOTUS justice will shape the law on issues that impact every American for generations. The Senate should not consider ANY Supreme Court nominee until after the midterm elections. #RoevWade is the law of the land and must remain the law of the land. Supreme Court vacancy or not. We are now 132 days away from the 2018 election. When Republicans committed to stealing Merrick Garland’s #SCOTUS seat, we were 269 away. Trump got a weaker deal with fewer commitments than any of his predecessors, and it is no surprise #NorthKorea is already taking advantage of its ambiguity. Congress is ready to step in to tighten the screws even if the President is not. … The 5-4 #SCOTUS #Janus decision may not be as high-profile as the #MuslimBan but it’s another big win for the right-wing in its decades-long war on the working class.

We can only assume this executive order would imprison children in the same correctional facilities as their parents. They will be sleeping in cages instead of cribs.  Families and children don’t belong in jail. Period. Trump’s executive order doesn’t end the zero-tolerance policy of prosecuting anyone and everyone who crosses the border improperly, it reaffirms it. This evening, I’ll be on the Senate floor speaking out against this cruel policy. Watch here:   The weakening of California’s #NetNeutrality bill shows what the forces we are facing are capable of. Every state deserves gold standard rules. That’s why the House of Reps should pass my CRA resolution immediately to reinstate net neutrality nationally. … WATCH: More @realDonaldTrump nominees for @EPA positions who have a hard time admitting humans are causing climate change.pic.twitter.com/6qWSj7UXCW The executive order doesn't end the zero-tolerance policy that created this crisis. In fact, the President now wants to detain parents and children together indefinitely, and contemplates DoD building internment camps to house them. This is no solution to a problem Trump created. Declaring June National Ocean Month is a nice sheen on Trump’s ocean policy, but between opening up 90% of our coasts to offshore drilling and now repealing the #NationalOceanPolicy, his admin is doing everything it can to allow another BP oil spill. … President Trump’s leadership may be devoid of compassion and humanity, but the American people are not. On #WorldRefugeeDay, we should each promise ourselves to do everything we can to fight for the safety and dignity of the most vulnerable. Fleeing violence and seeking asylum is not illegal.  Ripping babies away from mothers doesn’t make our country safe and secure.  You are entirely to blame for this.

But internet providers are working hard to weaken it. California lawmakers need to stay strong; everyone is watching. … It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to stop lying.

Watch here:  pic.twitter.com/MmtDcTXAto There is no law that requires the Trump administration to separate families. There is no court decision that mandates this. The decision to implement the barbaric “zero tolerance” policy is one the administration made on its own. … The @UN said as many as 250,000 people could be killed in this offensive. 18,000,000 Yemenis could be at risk of starvation by the end of the year.

The federal government hasn't done enough to assist or force accountability. I led 21 colleagues in demanding answers. … “I would do almost anything to deter the people from Central America,” - John Kelly when he ran DHS. The policy of separating families is designed to make coming to America such a traumatizing experience that migrants would rather choose to endure violence in their home country.pic.twitter.com/RF6Ba0xiLE Separating children from their parents as a form of punishment is barbaric.

That’s why I cosponsored the Child Care for Working Families Act that will provide parents and kids with #SummerCare. Glad you agree.

This is a direct attack on hundreds of thousands of American blue-collar workers. … Five people, including three former Trump aides, have *pleaded guilty* as a result of Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. … After a career defending voter suppression laws, suppressing workers’ rights, and encouraging white supremacists, Thomas Farr is President Trump’s nominee for a lifetime appointment as a judge on a federal district court. Senators must vote no on this awful choice. #CourtsMatter A week out from the #NorthKorea summit is not the time for bravado. Rudy Giuliani should stick to undermining @realDonaldTrump’s legal defense instead of undermining our chances at peace. … Robert F. Kennedy lifted up the spirit of our entire nation.

Kennedy #RFK50 #NorthKorea must understand that America is ready and willing to tighten the screws if it does not take concrete steps towards denuclearization. We simply cannot just take Kim Jong Un at his word. … Mark Zuckerberg needs to return to Congress and testify why @facebook shared Americans’ private information with questionable Chinese companies. Our privacy and national security cannot be the cost of doing business. … .@SenMarkey takes the stage to chat about air travel and the initiative to keep in-flight calls off planes: Just like we have reasonable safety and security policies for airline passengers, we need common sense to protect passengers from annoying airline chatter. #GBTALegSummitpic.twitter.com/iQCryh2H78 Students and teachers are dying. Families are mourning. Schools have become battlegrounds. And Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump are sticking their heads in the sand while the NRA rejoices. … President Trump sidelining John Bolton for stupidity on #NorthKorea was a good first start. Now he should fire Bolton for stupidity in general. … By accepting foreign emoluments w/o obtaining congressional consent,  Americans can't know whether Trump is making decisions based on the public interest, or his own business interests. That’s wrong. If Trump won't abide by our Constitution, our courts must require him to do so. There is serious debate about how best to address the myriad threats posed by #NorthKorea. But one thing remains crystal clear – there is no military solution to this problem.pic.twitter.com/dnSJGftUsl .@SenCoryGardner and I are leading a hearing with #NorthKorea diplomacy experts focused on the next steps for U.S. policy toward North Korea as President Trump prepares to meet with Kim Jong Un.

We know that our energy future won’t be found in the darkness of a mine but in the light of the sun. A year ago today, Trump announced America would leave the #ParisAgreement.  Despite his best efforts, many of our states, cities & citizens are continuing to look to the future, invest in clean energy & fight #climatechange.  Let’s keep it up. We’ll always have Paris... #StillIn It is encouraging that the #NorthKorea meeting is back on. Now, the focus must remain on tangibly reducing the threat from North Korean nuclear weapons, not simply producing a made-for-TV summit. The continued violence in #Nicaragua is reprehensible and the government must be held to account. Peaceful protests and independent journalism are core tenets of democracies and must never be threatened.  #SOSNicaragua … .@SenMarkey & I are introducing a bill to make @FEMA address the medium & long-term housing needs of survivors of Hurricane Maria & future natural disasters. Families are at risk of homelessness & a new hurricane season is about to begin – this can’t wait. … Gun licensing laws save lives.  Congress should pass my bill that incentivizes states to pass gun licensing laws. Why not require would-be gun buyers to complete a gun safety course & have a 1-on-1 interview with a police officer? #GunViolenceAwarenessDay … Now you can use one of those pens to sign your letter of resignation. #BootPruitt … Trump’s DOE is using an obscure provision to put the dying coal industry on a ventilator while the planet suffocates.  The free market has decided: clean energy is the future. We must stop bailing out coal plants on the backs of consumers and our climate. … American citizens deserve far better than the mistreatment our brothers and sisters in #PuertoRico have received. We must push for action in Congress so that they are at least provided the housing security they deserve. … As #climatechange and extreme weather worsen, mass evacuations will become more common. We need to be prepared, and so does our infrastructure. I’m introducing the ESCAPE Act that puts $1B toward expanding and improving our nation’s evacuation routes. … California is one step closer to restoring #NetNeutrality & making it the law of the land on the West Coast! It’s time for the House of Reps. in DC to heed the call of millions of innovators, entrepreneurs, & consumers & vote on the #NetNeutrality CRA. … FEMA has a program specifically designed to address the housing needs of survivors of natural disasters. The Trump admin refuses to activate it for Puerto Rican evacuees. @SenWarren & I are intro'ing a bill to provide stable housing for survivors of Maria. … Virginia expands Medicaid to 400,000 people. Illinois ratifies the Equal Rights Amendment. California’s Senate votes to restore #NetNeutrality.    This is who we are as a people, and what we could be as a country. Elections have consequences. The unimaginable suffering inflicted by separating families at the border is cruel, immoral, and completely manufactured by DOJ and DHS. The Trump administration can and must rescind the “zero tolerance policy” that is totally inconsistent with our values. … If true, the Chinese government must hold accountable those responsible for illegally transferring oil to a North Korean ship. And this shows why the U.S.-Japan alliance is key. … Wall Street profits are up while workers’ wages remain flat. It is outrageous that the Fed is letting the biggest banks gamble with your money yet again and turn our economy into a casino once more. … This is a lie. And it is a deadly one. The @CDCgov just said the #OpioidEpidemic is getting worse. Those suffering need recovery services, not Trump’s lip service. … 40% of inmates enter the prison system with a substance use disorder. To successfully transition back to their communities after their sentences, they need drug treatment. 7 of my colleagues and I are asking @USGAO to examine treatment programs offered at correctional facilities.pic.twitter.com/JYV1CJJVJG Last week, @SenMarkey gave the weekly @SenateDems address. Read this  @ShannonYoung413 article to see what he covered.      Watch the video here:  Congress should pass my MASS Act that incentivizes other states to adopt tough gun laws similar to those in Massachusetts and implement our proven methods, which have been successful in reducing deaths from gun violence. … In Massachusetts, would-be gun buyers "must complete a four-hour gun safety course, get character references from two people", and have a one-on-one interview with a police officer.  These laws save lives and should serve as a model for the nation. … In October, @SenWarren & I asked DHS to verify the official death count in Puerto Rico from Maria fearing the actual count could be 10x higher.   It’s 70x higher. This is either the result of shocking incompetence or a deliberate underestimation. Someone must be held accountable. Here’s what’s not confusing. Robert Mueller’s investigation has thus far resulted in 19 people being indicted or pleading guilty. Mueller is a top-tier investigator. If there’s crime, he’s going to find it. It’s not surprising that Trump is trying to undermine our justice system. Trump accuses those investigating Russian meddling in U.S. elections of meddling in U.S. elections & still hasn’t said the same about the Russians... who meddled in U.S. elections. It’s confusing & that’s the point. He wants to undermine faith in the effort to get to the truth. … The Trump @FCC’s #NetNeutrality repeal takes effect in less than two weeks. Has your representative signed the petition to fight back and protect the free internet? Check here:   Each flag on Boston Common today honors one of the 37,268 Massachusetts residents who died defending our nation since the Revolutionary War.

The Senate designated May as National Brain Tumor Awareness Month. Happy to join Sen. @SteveDaines, @SenatorCollins & Sen. @ChrisVanHollen to raise awareness about brain tumors & to support groups like @NBTStweets in their advocacy & outreach activities. #BTAM Ahead of the #MemorialDay weekend, #gasprices are spiking. @SenateDems are demanding @POTUS step in and act. WATCH:pic.twitter.com/yVwcXdZO5G Starting today, under the EU's new privacy law, Europeans’ data will belong to them, not corporations. I’ve introduced a resolution urging companies to give Americans the same safeguards. Americans deserve better than second-class privacy protections.   … Drug manufacturers must be held accountable for their role in the #OpioidCrisis.  I’m asking @SecAzar and others to investigate if the industry’s profit motives are improperly influencing the education that prescribers receive & endangering American lives. … Tune in soon! I’ll be talking today’s #NorthKorea news. … I’ll be on @CNN with @WolfBlitzer at 6 ET. Tune in for a discussion about @realDonaldTrump canceling the #NorthKorea summit and where we go from here. Sec. Pompeo refused to acknowledge that the “Libya model” @VP and Bolton suggested for #NorthKorea confirmed Kim Jong Un’s suspicions and contributed to cancellation of the summit. We should be negotiating peace. Unfortunately, it seems that our chief diplomat is negotiating war. Offshore wind has the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs in Massachusetts and up and down the East Coast, harness homegrown innovation, and reduce carbon pollution. … You can't begin a negotiation with NK by advocating for the worst conclusion for its leader & expect that negotiation to succeed. President Trump did little to disavow this declaration from his advisors & has approached this summit from the outset with naivete and inconsistency. When @VP Pence and John Bolton declared that Libya was a model for persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program, they confirmed Kim Jong Un’s deep-seated fears that the upcoming negotiations would be nothing more than a tactic to invade & disarm his country. I urge President Trump not to continue with the kind of threatening rhetoric that he used today in his letter, as it only serves to enflame and destabilize the region. While the challenges to a lasting agreement with North Korea are great, we should not abandon diplomacy. When people are sick, they get a treatment plan. America needs a nationwide treatment plan for fighting the #OpioidCrisis. The Opioid Milestones Act will provide national benchmarks for ensuring that our federal & state resources pay lifesaving dividends.   … The fight to save the internet is in full swing in the House. The Big Broadband special interests are counting on us to slow down and let up – don’t.   You can check to see if your Rep. has signed the petition to force a vote to save #NetNeutrality here:   Massachusetts just awarded the first contract to build an offshore wind farm off of our coast. This is such an important milestone. Rather than drilling for oil and gas off of the New England coast, we will find our energy future blowing in the wind. … Congratulations to Longmeadow’s own Brynn Cartelli for winning @NBCTheVoice, the youngest winner ever! All of Massachusetts was cheering you on and I’m sure you’ll continue to make us proud as you go on to do amazing things. .@SenMarkey, Dems demand that Trump act to lower gas prices #MApoli  …pic.twitter.com/c9ARTVEUDw America is exporting 2.5 million barrels of oil per day. Why send our oil overseas instead of keeping it here to benefit American families?  Because #BigOil stands to see $500 billion in new revenue over the next 20 years as a result of U.S. oil exports. … Americans are paying the price at the pump for Trump’s chaotic approach to foreign policy.    He hasn’t pressured Gulf leaders to lift their cap on oil output, or pursued diplomatic solutions in Yemen and Syria.   The result? $3.89 a gallon #GasPricespic.twitter.com/CTaW97cez9 America is exporting 2.5 million barrels of oil a day to China and elsewhere while we import that exact same amount from OPEC and the Middle East. That only makes sense to the #BigOil executives getting rich while American families are getting turned upside down at the pump. OPEC, Russia, & others have been conspiring to boost oil prices to hurt Americans. I’m introducing legislation that requires President Trump to negotiate with these nations to put an end to this cartel manipulating markets & take action against any country that refuses to stop. Here are 7 things @realDonaldTrump could do to bring down your gas costs -- read @SenatorCantwell @SenMarkey @SenatorMenendez & my letter asking him to help you save this summer:  …pic.twitter.com/cNuRWwNgBD LIVE: Gas prices have risen 25% since @realDonaldTrump took office.

More from @ColinAYoung in @statehousenews:   #mapoli Massachusetts is #1 in education in part because we pay our teachers fair wages. But for years, teachers across America have been asked to do more with less. This funding would improve salaries, upgrade classrooms, renovate schools and lift achievement. … In the Trump administration, it’s open season on any rule, regulation, or law that enforces even the most basic humanity or common sense in the way we treat our environment and wildlife.     The only bears @realDonaldTrump seems to want to protect are in Russia. … Scott Pruitt can’t stay out of the headlines even when he’s specifically trying to stay out of some headlines.    This is an affront to the First Amendment. Pruitt isn’t just outrageous, he’s downright dangerous, and he must be fired. … -incoherent foreign policy that roils oil markets -exporting American crude to China and elsewhere -dismantling fuel economy emissions standards -draining more than 1/3rd of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  Trump and the @GOP’s policies are driving up gas prices for Americans.pic.twitter.com/6Z1IFElbT9 .@realDonaldTrump says his agenda is ‘America First’, but the policies he and Republicans are pursuing put #BigOil first and American consumers last. … More and more American crude oil - now 2.5M barrels/day - is being shipped overseas, benefitting #BigOil and China at the expense of American consumers. That must stop. I’m introducing legislation that will put an immediate end to all new oil exports.   pic.twitter.com/vxdUvPTc33 The Supreme Court just dealt yet another crushing blow to labor. Conservatives love private arbitration because it allows employers to deny legal rights to workers. 5-4 SCOTUS decisions like this are the clearest example of elections having consequences. … Since @realDonaldTrump took office, gas prices have risen 25% — that means the average U.S. consumer is now paying roughly $350 more/year to fill up.   I have a plan to address rising gas prices:  China has claimed that its South China Sea construction was for purposes like “meteorological observation, environmental protection, and fishery production service.” Which one of those includes nuclear-capable, long-range bomber flights?” … A nuke is a nuke, period. “Low-yield” weapons incinerated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Instead of leading efforts to reintroduce nukes into warfighting, America should continue to lead global efforts to reduce and eventually entirely eliminate nuclear weapons. … Did you know? In 2006, the Congressional CF Caucus was launched by @SenMarkey and @RepCliffStearns. It is one of the largest congressional caucuses of its kind. #CFadvocacypic.twitter.com/apXRQZZJK5 This debate of the president having the power and pressure to launch nukes is too real. That’s why @SenMarkey & @tedlieu introduced a bill prohibiting presidents from launching a nuclear first strike without declaration of war by Congress. #MadamSecretary … "If you want to change our nuclear policy, you need the people on your side." Amen.   #MadamSecretary It’s time Congress put limits on the President’s unilateral authority to launch a nuclear first strike. We should pass HR 669/S 200 by @RepTedLieu & me which requires @POTUS to get congressional approval before launching a nuclear first strike. #MadamSecretary … As long as @realDonaldTrump has a Twitter account, the U.S. needs a nuclear no first use policy. #MadamSecretary … We have had so many close nuclear calls that it can fill a book. Literally. #MadamSecretary … Seconds after the warning of a *possible* nuclear attack reaches the President — and without the benefit of total confidence in the incoming information — the pressure to launch a counterstrike will be intense. It will all hinge on one person’s sole judgment. #MadamSecretary "Does anyone have any reason to believe that our systems could be wrong?" The answer is always YES. As Douglas Adams said, "A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools." #MadamSecretary For any reason or for no reason at all, @realDonaldTrump could launch a nuclear first strike and no one could stop him. That’s wrong. That’s why @RepTedLieu and I authored a bill to require congressional authorization before we start a nuclear war. #MadamSecretary … As soon as we see the name of a high school trending, we know it’s a school shooting. This isn’t normal and none of us should accept it as normal. #SantaFeHighSchool Yesterday, we found out @realDonaldTrump doesn’t know the difference between HPV and HIV.   Today, he will impose a new gag rule that threatens access to vital reproductive health care services through #TitleX.   This is an all-out war on women’s basic rights. We must fight back. Congress failed the victims at Sante Fe High School. I am disgusted and angry that we continue to fail our kids. I grieve with the families and friends who have lost loved ones.  But thoughts and prayers must be accompanied by real solutions. Otherwise, it’s an empty platitude. Senate passage of the bill to #SaveNetNeutrality yesterday was a major victory. The House must approve it as well. I have filed a discharge petition to force a vote on the bill to #SaveTheInternet. Now we need 218 Representatives to sign it.pic.twitter.com/TJsZDdvvbP Gina Haspel ran one of the CIA’s first overseas “rendition, detention, and interrogation” programs in Thailand.

Let’s continue the conversation. This is the European Council President saying America’s helping hand is so small under Trump that America’s friendship is an illusion. “America First” is more than a campaign slogan, it’s a naive ideology that has consequences like the erosion of our most important relationships. … .@realDonaldTrump, would you speak that way about your ancestors? Let me tell you something: When you attack immigrants, you're attacking me. You're attacking my grandfather who crossed the Rio Grande to pursue the American Dream. RT to tell Pres. Trump you stand with immigrants! … Thanks to @SenMarkey for your leadership in the Senate on #NetNeutrality and to the CEOs of @Zipcar @Carbonite @MathWorks @rapid7 and 36 other tech leaders who signed on to the @MassTLC letter in support of net neutrality protections! … The people saying we can’t win on #NetNeutrality in the House are the same people who, just 5 months ago, were saying we could never do it in the Senate.   Ignore them. Just keep fighting. Thanks to my partner @SenMarkey for leading the charge in the Senate to save #NetNeutrality. We won this fight today because the American people made their voices heard – our colleagues in the House should listen. … Celebrate today’s historic #NetNeutrality victory in the Senate. But the fight in the House starts TOMORROW. Make sure your representative knows how you feel about #NetNeutrality. Narrow margin? Unfortunately, 52 votes confirmed you as Chairman, @AjitPaiFCC.

All Americans - not just those who can afford to pay more - should have access to a free and open internet in this day and age The final #NetNeutrality vote will be tight. But that doesn’t reflect how Americans feel.  Outside of D.C., #NetNeutrality isn’t a partisan issue at all. And it shouldn’t be!

The momentum continues to grow. #NetNeutrality  … We vote TODAY on a resolution to save #NetNeutrality. I will vote to defend the open internet – it’s a necessity for our small businesses, our families and our future. I’ve been in the technology business longer than I’ve been in politics, and I can tell you the Trump Administration’s plan to repeal #NetNeutrality is bad news for consumers, small businesses, and the entire internet. I’m voting to stop the repeal of Net Neutrality. Without #NetNeutrality, Comcast, Verizon, AT&T and Charter would be free to throttle or even block #Yanny truthers. Tomorrow we will vote on an measure to restore #NetNeutrality. Now is the time to keep speaking out -- let your voice be heard. The Senate votes TODAY to restore #NetNeutrality, but the vote will be close. It's up to us all to fight, because to attack net neutrality is to attack free speech. Don't stay silent: Make your voice heard, right now, to help save the internet as we know it. This is the big one! Today the Senate votes to save #NetNeutrality. We are just hours away from a vote, so there is still time to make your voice heard and let your Senators know you support a free and open internet. #BlackLivesMatter. #WomensMarch. #MeToo. #NeverAgain.

We should treat it like a utility. The Senate needs to vote to restore #NetNeutrality tomorrow. Tomorrow, the Senate will take the most important vote for the internet in its history. For our economy, our democracy, and for everyday Americans, there is only one choice: save #NetNeutrality. If we don’t save #NetNeutrality @AjitPaiFCC will turn the internet into a digital oligarchy.  But don’t agonize, organize! Keep making noise! Speak out before it’s too late!pic.twitter.com/rW3JzcKNZu I tried to stump the students on @WGBH's @HS_QuizShow with this question about a landmark moment in protecting the environment. Do you know the answer? … Harry Reid is as tough as nails. When he fights, he fights with everything he’s got. I’m confident his battle with cancer is no different. My thoughts are with him and his family and I’m hoping for his full recovery. The @FTC must investigate the potential deceptive acts and practices used by @Google to track and commoditize Americans. … We're on the clock. The Senate will be voting on the CRA to save #NetNeutrality this Wednesday, 5/16. If you want to continue to enjoy the free & open internet as you do today, please make your voices heard before it's too late!pic.twitter.com/c7qgBet1Kp On Wednesday, the Senate will vote on my resolution to save #NetNeutrality. We need you to take action TODAY.pic.twitter.com/uuvGUIsPe1 It’s official. We will have a vote on our CRA to save #NetNeutrality this Wednesday. You have 3 days to make your voices heard and help get #OneMoreVote!pic.twitter.com/kQcOhb83VV BREAKING: The Senate’s vote to save #NetNeutrality will take place this Wednesday, May 16th. Keep raising your voices for the free and open internet. The fight is on! Ajit Pai wants #NetNeutrality to die on June 11th. The Senate can vote to save it.   If there ever was a time to make your voice heard, it’s now.   #OneMoreVotepic.twitter.com/CfpdcVJ1Z8 My mother was the best student in her high school class but she had to forgo college to take care of her sisters. I thank her every day for helping me be the first in my family to go to college. There isn’t enough we can say or do for the amazing mothers in our lives. #MothersDaypic.twitter.com/KUjaLfNAbk The most important vote for the internet in the history of the United States Senate is coming this week.  Which side are your senators on?  #NetNeutrality #OneMoreVotepic.twitter.com/Cyfb0KrXaN This morning I joined @SenWarren, @SenMarkey, @JonMitchellNB and members of the New Bedford fishing community to discuss offshore wind and the Sector IX closure.pic.twitter.com/ZYi0iiVMid .@SenMarkey shared his thoughts about the Iran deal, net neutrality, and more during a @BosPublicRadio appearance on Thursday. Full interview and details via @Tori_Bedford:   #mapoli When I spoke with Philips Lighting CEO Chris White last week, I asked him if he had even visited the plant in Fall River. He said no.  Mr. White should come to Fall River, look every family in the eye, and apologize for this terrible decision.pic.twitter.com/zhXBOirc09 No company should ever ship American jobs overseas. I’m in Fall River to stand in solidarity with the 160 Philips Lighting workers who are losing their jobs after the company announced it will move their jobs to Mexico and Canada. I promise to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with you. ICYMI: I joined @CenkUygur on @TheYoungTurks to talk about this week’s historic fight to save #NetNeutrality. … .@SenSchumer, @SenMarkey, and four dozen other senators teamed up in an attempt to save #NetNeutrality before next month's vote deadline. Learn why they're so concerned via @AlyssaNewcomb and @NBCNews.  Kim Jong Un offered to shut his nuclear test site as a concession. But a new report shows that it is more of a distraction. @realDonaldTrump must focus on reducing the real threat: nuclear ICBMs. … .@realDonaldTrump's “huge” announcement on drug pricing turns out to be no more than empty promises. For a speech that was delayed three times, Americans were hoping to hear something real, not another whitepaper low on details. … It's Military Spouse Appreciation Day. Whether serving in active duty or supporting a military spouse, when one member of a family joins the military, the entire family makes an enormous sacrifice. I want to thank all of the military families in #MA for your courage and strength. While the ‘Destroying Internet Freedom’ rules may take effect on 6/11/18, this is not the final word: 50 US Senators have said NO. 2 states passed laws. 23 state attys general sued to #StopTheFCC. 6 governors & 100+ mayors have pushed back. And then there is YOU. #NetNeutrality NASA is axing this program due to “higher priorities in the science budget.” Climate change is THE #1 scientific priority, but this is what happens when a climate change denying President appoints a climate change denying NASA Administrator. … Tech underpins 34% of jobs in Massachusetts. In 2017, 70% of tech leaders in #MA said they plan to increase workforce in the next 12 months. Repealing #NetNeutrality puts all of that in jeopardy. … Simply put, my CRA resolution will put #NetNeutrality back on the books because in 2018, access to a free and open internet isn’t a privilege, it’s a RIGHT.  #OneMoreVote Third, the CRA will prevent ISPs from setting up internet fast and slow lanes. ISPs won’t be able to charge large websites for access to an internet fast lane while websites that can’t afford the internet EZ pass will load at a bumper to bumper pace. Second, the CRA will ensure ISPs cannot throttle, or slow down, a website of their choosing, especially a competitor. First, the CRA will protect websites from being entirely blocked by ISPs (internet service providers). That means an ISP cannot block a video chat service, just so you’ll use their own service. And it will prevent ISPs from blocking a website with a contrary political viewpoint. Next week’s vote on my resolution to *fully* restore #NetNeutrality will be the most important vote for the internet in the history of the United States Senate.   Here's what the CRA resolution means for you: Live now! … SOON: I’ll be discussing the historic battle to save #NetNeutrality with @AliVelshi. Tune in to @MSNBC at 3:45 ET! W/ 50 Senators on board, we have enough support to force a vote to save #NetNeutrality but our fight is not over. We still need #OneMoreVote to pass our resolution & reinstate net neutrality rules so the internet can remain free & open for all Michiganders  Next week, when we force a vote on my resolution to save #NetNeutrality, every senator will have to go on record on how they see the internet: a dynamic, diverse, democratic space that fosters innovation, or just another market for massive corporations to control.  #OneMoreVotepic.twitter.com/TOH1Q0Ey3y The @FCC just announced it will officially revoke #NetNeutrality rules on June 11! The Senate needs just #OneMoreVote to pass @SenMarkey’s resolution (SJRes 52), and then the House must pass my companion bill (HJRes 129) to #SaveTheInternet. #RedAlert .@SenMarkey says Democrats willing to work with President to impose sanctions without throwing out deal. "You do not need to redo the whole house in order to remodel the kitchen." .@SenMarkey on Iran deal: "The point on the Iran deal is that it is working. It was not something that was being violated...It is under comprehensive International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring." Good morning! @criticalthawt is guest-hosting today with Margery. First up: We're talking with @SenMarkey about the end of the Iran deal. Listen:  I'll be on @JimandMargery talking about President Trump's terrible decision to leave the #IranDeal, the fight to save #NetNeutrality, and more! … Today @bospublicradio, both MA U S senators will join us: @senmarkey & @SenWarren....got a question? Tweet @bospublicradio...#mapoli BREAKING: The Trump FCC has announced that #NetNeutrality protections will officially end on June 11th.

Now, we just need #OneMoreVote. … The American people are paying close attention to who is fighting for them and who is sitting on the sidelines.   This vote on #NetNeutrality is coming, and when it does, it will be crystal clear who is protecting corporate buddies and who is fighting for everyday Americans. Don’t be fooled by the voices that say this is all doom and gloom & that the ISPs would NEVER block or throttle content. Mark my words, without #NetNeutrality, these are not alarmist & hypothetical harms. They are real, & without #NetNeutrality they may become the new normal. The fight to save #NetNeutrality is a fight for the most powerful platform in the history of the planet, the internet. And in 2018, access to a free and open internet is a right, not a privilege.   #OneMoreVote LIVE: We are entering the homestretch in the historic battle to save #NetNeutrality here in the Senate.

My colleagues and I are forcing a vote to overturn the FCC's decision to repeal net neutrality. This fight is not over. … We’re on red alert for #NetNeutrality. Putting corporations in control of what you see on the internet undermines freedom of speech, freedom of expression. #NetNeutrality ensures the internet remains free, open and democratic. The reason why the @realDonaldTrump administration repealed #NetNeutrality is simple: it sides with the rich and the powerful first, and consistently, without fail, puts everyday Americans last.  But today, the internet is fighting back.  #OneMoreVote #SaveTheInternet Today’s the day. Today we officially file the petition to force a vote to save net neutrality.

At 4:30 ET I’ll be on @CNBC to talk about @realDonaldTrump’s dangerous decision. Tune in. This decision has left us isolated from our closest European allies, less secure, and without any strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons other than another deadly war. My full statement: … Leaving the #IranDeal frees Iran to immediately re-start nuclear activities, encourages its rivals to pursue their own nuclear weapons programs, risks a calamitous military conflict in the Middle East, and bolsters Iran's hardliners.  @realDonaldTrump has made a terrible mistake. Tomorrow, the petition that allows @SenateDems to force a vote on my resolution to save #NetNeutrality will be officially filed.  A vote is coming. Spread the word.  #OneMoreVote Torture has no place in civilized society. The atrocities committed on Gina Haspel’s watch were barbaric, immoral, and ineffective.

Via @usatodayopinion:   #mapoli Congress should pass my MASS Act that incentivizes other states to adopt tough gun laws similar to those in Massachusetts. … In Massachusetts, would-be gun buyers "must complete a four-hour gun safety course, get character references from two people", and have a one-on-one interview with a police officer.  We have the lowest gun death rate in America. Let's do this everywhere. … We’re on target to increase the average fuel economy to nearly 39 mpg in 2020 and more than 50 mpg in 2025. But President Trump seems determined to undermine that progress. … "We have an obligation to American families, service members, and our allies to say – unequivocally – that we did everything in our power to curb North Korea's dangerous behavior without resorting to conflict" Massachusetts doesn’t need @realDonaldTrump’s deadly NRA talking points. We have some of the toughest gun safety laws in the country and its LOWEST gun death rate. My MASS Act would make our laws a national model. … Do you see your Senators?  If not, they need to know how you feel about #NetNeutrality TODAY. My resolution will *fully* restore #NetNeutrality and we only need #OneMoreVote to pass it in the Senate.pic.twitter.com/KZIaPmAIMM In active shooter situations, communication & planning are critical. This week, the @NFPA released NFPA3000 to make sure local communities have a plan during these tragic situations. This framework will be vital for communities in #MA & across the country.  … ICYMI: By trying to dismantle ambitious fuel economy emissions standards, @realDonaldTrump is doing a favor for #BigOil at the expense of consumers, the climate, & innovation. @SenFeinstein & I stand in solidarity with the states resisting Trump's efforts. … The current fuel economy standards are working, saving drivers money at the pump while reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions. There's no reason for the Trump administration to weaken them now. Read my op-ed with @SenMarkey: … This fight isn’t over. We need just one more senator to reject corporate interests and instead stand with the families, workers, small business owners, and students they represent to get this passed in the Senate. #NetNeutrality … Don't succumb to the illusion that it is possible to strike a grand bargain that solves the problem overnight. Do not "try to negotiate the details with Kim Jong Un." Diplomacy and sustained engagement is our only option for peace. - @SenMarkey at #ACAsia .@SenMarkey: While the challenge with North Korea is great, we should not abandon optimism.
