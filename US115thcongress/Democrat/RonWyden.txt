To secure our elections and prevent future attacks, we need #PaperBallotsNOW. My #PAVEAct ensures every vote counts and American elections are protected against meddling and hacking. Instead of Trump’s trade chaos, we need concrete, well-planned strategies that WILL create auto manufacturing jobs and deliver for American workers. Trump’s trade policy dictated by early-morning tweets may end up costing American jobs and doing more harm than good. … Survivors, I believe you. If you need support, @RAINN is available 24/7 to provide resources and listen. … How can any senator, in good conscience, allow Kavanaugh's nomination process to move forward? In light of this morning's appalling new allegations, Friday's vote MUST be called off. Tomorrow's hearing, if it happens, cannot be the last on Kavanaugh's alleged sexual misconduct. ALL allegations must be investigated fully by the FBI - the WH must not stand in the way. … Credible allegations deserve a credible process. The Senate has an obligation to provide vigorous oversight, and Republican senators don't want to be part of it. Republicans ramming through Kavanaugh’s nomination and holding a vote on Friday sends a clear statement that they believe women’s voices DON’T matter. #StopKavanaughpic.twitter.com/c3Z6luRsGj From Memorial Day to last weekend, here’s a wrap-up of all that @RonWyden was working on this summer in Oregon – wildfire prevention, #2018townhalls, #PaperBallotsNow, #StopKavanaugh & much more: … Bottom Line - Every American should have the chance to VOTE without jumping over obstacles. Every American should have the confidence that their VOTE is being counted. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay #BeAVoter At least 40 MILLION voters are using insecure election machines that have NO paper record of the votes. That’s like leaving ballot boxes on a Moscow street corner. Paper ballots and mandatory audits are the best way to make sure our elections are legitimate. #PaperBallotsNOW Vote-by-mail makes it easier for    Students  Seniors  People living with disabilities  All Americans   To #VOTE  It’s critical our country takes Oregon’s vote-by-mail system nationwide. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay  …? The most SECURE way to protect our democracy, prevent voter suppression and ensure every vote counts, is to use paper ballots and vote-by-mail. #PaperBallotsNOW #NationalVoterRegistrationDay … My resolution with @RepVeasey will spark voter registration and encourage Congress to protect voting rights. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay … I’m proud to lead the effort to name September *Voting Rights Month* with @RepVeasey. It’s clear that a voter suppression campaign is underway in many parts of our country, and we must do all we can to secure our elections from foreign hackers. LIVE – I’m joining @RepVeasey, @repjohnlewis, @SenatorCardin, @JoaquinCastrotx, @RepJudyChu and @RepTerriSewell to share the importance of protecting voting rights on #NationalVoterRegistrationDay … The most important way to use your voice to make a difference is to VOTE. Celebrate #NationalVoterRegistrationDay and visit   to learn how to register and #BeAVoter.pic.twitter.com/syXsJrikxJ Bottom line - If @realDonaldTrump fires Rod Rosenstein for the purpose of protecting himself from the Mueller investigation, that would represent high crimes and misdemeanors. Interfering with the Mueller investigation would be an ATTACK on our democracy. @realDonaldTrump is NOT above the law. If Republicans in Congress are serious about the investigation, they must step up and support legislation to protect Mueller from partisan politics.pic.twitter.com/zc57oJcEiB Political ads are flooding the airwaves in homes across the US. Because of Trump’s new dark money rule, the IRS won’t know whether the $$$ paying for those ads comes from lawbreaking special interest groups or foreigners. … Remember - @stevenmnuchin1’s announcement swirled with suspicion. @USTreasury made it easier for foreign donors to funnel dark money into US orgs came hours after alleged Russian spy Maria Butina was arrested for using NRA to influence our elections. … My resolution with @SenatorTester reverses Trump’s undemocratic agenda to empower shadowy groups looking to buy our elections. Opposition against our measure is an endorsement of Trump’s plan to rid our campaign finance system of transparency. … Attacking these women and jamming the Kavanaugh nomination through while these allegations of sexual misconduct mount would go down among the darkest moments in Senate history. Republicans still on the fence must decide if they want to be a part of it. There’s a sea-change happening across the country with respect to the treatment of women and sexual misconduct. What’s happening with Kavanaugh’s nomination shows Republicans in Washington don’t get it – and are content ignoring it. There’s no reason – other than a shameful desire to win at any cost – to rush this process, block an FBI investigation into these multiple allegations and force a Senate vote on Kavanaugh. Calling for these women to be heard & for their allegations to be investigated isn’t a “smear campaign.” Even if you believe Kavanaugh, you should welcome a routine FBI background check! But Leader McConnell & the admin. are blocking it. Why don’t they want to get to the truth? Multiple women have come forward with credible allegations of sexual misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh. Speaking out was a huge sacrifice of safety and privacy. Now they’re being called liars and attacked as if it’s all a political stunt. This is as cynical as politics get in Washington. #StopKavanaugh … Meanwhile, Big Pharma is trying to airdrop a bailout into an unrelated piece of legislation that would cost taxpayers billions AND increase seniors’ Medicare premiums. I’m fighting this effort to pad Big Pharma’s bottom line that would shift costs onto seniors. Trump’s top health care official, @SecAzar, *never* lowered drug prices while he was a Big Pharma executive. Why would his former pharma colleagues start now? Trump's drug plan is all talk, no action. … It’s still “business as usual” for Big Pharma: jacking up prices every year, leaving families on the hook for higher and higher costs. Trump has failed to keep his promise to Americans. … The Trump admin is yet again combining racism, cruelty and economic self-harm in one policy to target seniors who count on Medicare for affordable prescriptions, caregivers in America’s nursing homes and daycares, and workers who contribute to every sector of the economy. Immigrants do not take from this country, they add to it. The Trump administration is too blinded by racism to understand that. … Trump’s new policy harms rural areas with declining populations that are starved for residents who want to build a better life for their families and contribute to the community. This anti-immigrant policy will be a disaster. Given the serious and credible assault allegations against him, the FBI MUST reopen Kavanaugh’s background investigation. Republicans’ plan to rush his nomination for a LIFETIME seat before a simple investigation has been conducted is a farce. Read the letter I wrote @SenateMajLdr, @SenSchumer, @RoyBlunt and @SenAmyKlobuchar about legislation I am introducing to address the threat of cyber threats on Senate email accounts:  … Foreign hackers are going after personal email accounts of elected officials and staff working to serve the American people. Congress needs to step up its defense against these attacks. … The fact that a pharma bailout is even being considered is outrageous. It would increase seniors' premiums, costs more than twice as much as what we're spending on opioids and  gives pharma a windfall instead of lowering America's drug prices. Big Pharma is trying to airdrop a multi-billion dollar bailout into a bill meant to tackle the opioid crisis. I'm fighting to stop this awful bailout in its tracks.  …? Good morning @oregonfootball fans watching @CollegeGameDay. I’m looking forward to Lee Corso picking the Ducks and to being at tonight’s game in Autzen – the loudest stadium in college football. #GoDucks Residents & health-care providers in southern Oregon shared w/me this afternoon in Medford how protections for pre-existing conditions save lives. We can’t let Donald Trump take us backwards on health care with Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court. #StopKavanaugh.pic.twitter.com/vSUPO3nOeT Great teachers like Keri Pilgrim-Ricker at @CHSLancers in the @4Jschools are crucial to great education for young people. Big congrats to her for earning honors as @ORDeptEd teacher of the year: … Heard today in Bend from central Oregonians about the life-and-death importance of preserving health-care protections for people w/pre-existing conditions. Judge Kavanaugh would threaten these hard-earned protections. #StopKavanaugh.pic.twitter.com/1l9WtUZ7OZ One year later, families in #PuertoRico are still recovering from the aftermath of #HurricaneMaria. Many are still grieving the loss of their loved ones – nearly 3,000 lost. We have so much to do to make sure our fellow Americans recover from the devastation. Hanford workers are finally getting the Energy Department to agree to protect them from harmful vapors and dangerous chemicals venting from high-level waste tanks.  It’s time for the House of Representatives to take up the Senate’s resolution passed with a bipartisan vote to return real #NetNeutrality to the internet. Real #NetNeutrality is essential for Oregon #SmallBiz and creating a level playing field in our global economy with more choices for consumers. Without #NetNeutrality, giant corporations can strangle startup companies before they ever get out of the garage. The Trump admin's cruel, arbitrary decision to slash the number of refugees who can enter America won’t do a thing to make us safer or stronger. It only robs us of people who want to work hard to make a better life here. Shutting our doors to refugees runs contrary to everything America represents. My parents made a home in America after fleeing the Nazis. Other people fleeing war and oppression deserve the same opportunities. … Saturday is National Public Lands Day! Celebrate by taking time to #GetOutdoors. It’s critical we protect our natural treasures in Oregon and across the country and provide access to outdoor recreation for all Americans. #NPLD … Earlier this summer, I visited the Rockwood @BGCPortland to visit the kids, donate hundreds of books from the @librarycongress and shoot a few hoops. Oregon’s Boys and Girls Club provides essential services for youth and creates an amazing community for learning. #OregonWaypic.twitter.com/gk7qMZ2qPn The Trump admin’s only play is to slap tariffs to raise prices on a growing list of products used by American consumers and hope China blinks first. Trump’s tactics have yet to produce any REAL change in China's behavior & only create chaos for US businesses, workers & consumers. … Make no mistake - Republicans are coming after your Medicare and Social Security. We must #ProtectOurCare. … Retired Gen. James Thayer served our country & our state with great distinction in World War II and for decades afterward. I’m sad to learn about his passing. My condolences to his family: … Sending @JohnDingell best wishes for a speedy recovery. We all want to see you well and tweeting again soon! … We must STOP the secrecy and rushed process of Kavanaugh’s #SCOTUS nomination. Until we have a full investigation, Kavanaugh should not be reported out of the Judiciary Committee. Christine Blasey Ford made the brave choice to come forward. She must be heard and respected. Trump’s former campaign chair admitted today he concealed his work for Russian allies and dodged U.S. taxes by laundering millions of dollars through shell corporations. Who else is hiding under paper thin transparency laws to defraud taxpayers? #FollowTheMoney Early childhood educators in Oregon and across the country do critical work to support children, families & employers. I’m proud to be a cosponsor of the Child Care for Working Families Act. All #ECE educators should earn a living wage.  #ChildCare4All.  The Trump administration wants to deport unaccompanied children that judges have found to have been abused, abandoned, or neglected. Deporting them now is cruelty for the sake of cruelty. Trump's ICE now plans to deport 350,000 people whose cases were already CLOSED. This waste of taxpayer resources to carry out a cold partisan vendetta against immigrants goes too far.  My @SenateDems colleagues and I are pushing back.  … #SNAP is critical for fighting hunger and provides a true safety net for families walking on an economic tight rope. Around 645,000 Oregonians are enrolled in #SNAP. @oregonfoodbank CEO Susannah Morgan explains why #SNAP matters to Oregon families. #HungerActionMonth #ProtectSNAPpic.twitter.com/iiIBJkkw99 September is #HungerActionMonth. I’m proud to fight alongside @oregonfoodbank to #EndHunger and #FeedTheHumanSpirit. #OregonWaypic.twitter.com/R8iat7h4ml If they’re going to choose to increase the deficit by ANOTHER $3 trillion, why aren’t Republicans using this money to protect every single hardworking American who is not going to get the #SocialSecurity benefits they EARNED … Republicans are plowing forward with ANOTHER round of tax cuts for the wealthy rather than preventing cuts to #SocialSecurity benefits into the 2040s. #GOPTaxScam Keep fighting. Keep speaking out. Keep sharing #WhatsAtStake. #StopKavanaughpic.twitter.com/dADjUk3wqe Before Kavanaugh’s markup today, I met with activists who are speaking out about #WhatsAtStake. Change starts at the grassroots. Thank you for getting loud and sharing why we MUST #STOPKavanaugh!pic.twitter.com/yTkXFTosB2 If confirmed to #SCOTUS Kavanaugh will    Fulfill Trump’s pledge to appoint justices who will overturn #RoevWade  Strike down #ACA & protections for the 130 MILLION Americans w/ preexisting conditions    Side w/ Big Brother & Big Business instead of individual liberties Kavanaugh lied about his record. He lied about using stolen documents. He lied about his work on illegal warrantless wiretapping. He must NOT be allowed to lie his way onto #SCOTUS. #StopKavanaugh Kavanaugh’s record is brimming with hostility toward individual liberties, affordable health care and women’s rights. If he’s confirmed, he will be another rubber stamp for Trump on #SCOTUS. #StopKavanaugh .@SenSasse, good thinking. Want to cosponsor my Presidential Tax Transparency Act? #ReleaseTheReturns  … … Hardworking Americans are left with Trump’s broken promise to increase wages by $4,000, while big companies and their shareholders are cashing in on the #GOPTaxScam. … Trump’s nominee for IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig did NOT say he’d change Trump’s dark money rule despite numerous opportunities. I will be opposing his nomination. The Trump administration has weaponized the tax code against Americans with Trump’s dark money rule and the #GOPTaxScam. I will keep working to fix Trump’s dark money crisis and undo the #GOPTaxScam’s damage. For the next two months, political ads are going to flood the airwaves. Because of the Trump admin’s dark money rule, there may not be any way to determine if the $$$ behind those ads came from lawbreaking foreigners and special interests. Don’t forget - The Trump admin’s change happened only hours after accused Russian spy Maria Butina was indicted for using @NRA to influence our elections. … The Trump admin’s change had NO debate in @SenateFinance and NO debate on the Senate floor before it became law of the land. Before, dark money groups were required to disclose their donors to the IRS. Now, the Trump admin is letting MORE dark money and foreign money into our politics without any disclosure. This is unjustifiable. I’m voting NO on Trump’s pick for IRS commissioner, Charles Rettig, because Trump’s IRS and @USTreasury are making it easier for dark money and foreign money to undermine our democracy. I’m speaking out on the Senate floor:  … I’m joining @SenCoryGardner, @SenMarkey, @RandPaul and @SenatorShaheen in calling on @SecPompeo at @StateDept to take the basic steps needed to protect against phishing, hacks and other cyberattacks.  … Congrats, @DrLeanaWen. I look forward to working with you in the fight to protect health care equity and access. #IStandWithPP … Big congrats to the robotics club at @OregonState for winning this impressive international competition. … Proud to join @RepVeasey for our bicameral resolution to increase voter registration and protect the right to #VOTE. Let’s make September Voting Rights Month. … When we vote, we make our voices heard and defend our democracy. #VOTE .@realDonaldTrump and his administration are determined to make it HARDER for young people, seniors and people of color to #VOTE. I’m fighting for ways like the #PAVEAct and national vote-by-mail to ensure ALL Americans are empowered to participate in democracy.pic.twitter.com/jpLNaUfIAV I’m proud to introduce a resolution in the Senate that would make September “National Voting Rights Month” to bring awareness to the issue of voter suppression. It’s past time for Congress to take real action to empower every American to #VOTE and end voter suppression tactics. WATCH - Kavanaugh thinks there's nothing wrong with using stolen emails to advance a political agenda. Good thing that won't come up again, though.  #StopKavanaugh … A vote for this new bill is a vote for #GOPTaxScam 2.0 – ANOTHER round of tax hikes on middle-class families and working Americans. … Seventeen years later, we remember the innocent lives lost on 9/11, their families and the heroic first responders. #NeverForget What else is he lying about? His views on overturning #RoevWade? Whether he was involved in Bush-era torture programs? Whether he believes Trump can pardon himself? #StopKavanaugh Kavanaugh used stolen documents and LIED about it for personal gain.  This isn't complicated. He is unworthy of a seat on #SCOTUS. #StopKavanaugh … There are more victims of #Equifax breach than there are households in the US. If you had your identity stolen in the past year, there is a good chance that it is Equifax’s fault. Over 145 million Americans had their personal data stolen by #Equifax hackers one year ago today. Families are watching their finances disappear and credit scores shrink as thieves continue to open phony accounts. … It was an honor to have my office congratulate Damon Faust on his @AmericanLegion Firefighter of the Year award. Thank you to @clackamascounty for holding a wonderful ceremony.

This isn't a question of if bad guys get in. It’s just a question of WHEN. … More than 84.3% of security professionals at Black Hat 2018 said there’d be "malicious hacking" during this the midterm elections. This is a national security issue. Congress must act IMMEDIATELY to protect our democracy from cyberattacks #PaperBallotsNOW … All of the experts say you need two things to secure our elections: 1. Paper ballots 2. Risk-limiting audits.   My #PAVEAct does both. #PaperBallotsNow … Traveling throughout Oregon, I’ve always had a huge appreciation for our state’s gold-standard geographic guide – Lewis L. McArthur. I’m saddened by the passing of this Oregon icon and offer my condolences to his family: … Russia microtargeted minorities to spread lies designed to stop minority communities from voting. I asked @sherylsandberg how @facebook plans to stop future voter suppression.pic.twitter.com/3iZHCezqa5 The Trump White House must make Kavanaugh’s COMPLETE White House record available to the Senate & public. I’m joining 18 of my Senate Democratic colleagues in demanding its release. What is the administration hiding from the American people? #StopKanavaughpic.twitter.com/oBPCDuGXV4 This president is intent on turning government agencies into his own private muscle to hunt down his personal enemies. This is exactly why I fought for years to put checks on government power. … During his time in the #WhiteHouse, Judge Kavanaugh coached President Bush’s judicial nominees on how to give .@SenateDems vague, meaningless assurances about Roe v. Wade. This week he followed his own blueprint.pic.twitter.com/FKCTqIzSpJ  When the Trump administration covered up Gina Haspel's record to get her confirmed to @CIA, I warned it set a dangerous precedent. Now, they're running the same playbook with Brett Kavanaugh to get a lifetime appointment to #SCOTUS. … Stop belittling women as “hysterical” and “passionate” over #RoevWade. Before Roe, hundreds of women DIED every year because abortion was unsafe. Kavanaugh overturning Roe is a threat to women’s lives and freedom. #StopKavanaugh Forget Kavanaugh's well-rehearsed playacting in his nomination hearing. These documents make it clear that Kavanaugh would OVERTURN #RoevWade.  … The Senate said loud and clear that this practice has to stop. The House should immediately pass this bipartisan bill so it can be signed into law before any more seniors and families get ripped off. Pharma middlemen have been taking advantage of America’s broken drug pricing system for too long by banning pharmacists from telling customers the lowest available price for their medication. … .@SenatorLeahy's questions about Kavanaugh and stolen documents cannot go unanswered. The American people deserve to see these documents. #StopKavanaugh … Personal data is now the weapon of choice for political influence campaigns and we must NOT make it easier for foreign adversaries to seize these weapons.

Republican Attorney Generals are arguing preexisting condition protections should be GUTTED. LIVE: I’m speaking out with Senator Murphy and @SenTinaSmith about the threat of #TexasvUnitedStates on the health care coverage of millions of Americans with preexisting conditions. Tune in … Today, Kavanaugh will be ducking when asked to confirm his commitment to these health care rights.  It’s clear Trump nominated him to be a reliable vote to push his agenda of health care discrimination of vulnerable Americans. #StopKavanaugh #WhatsAtStake  … Today, two catastrophic forces are coming together that will have dire consequences for the future of Americans’ health care - Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings and #TexasvUS #WhatsAtStake It’s not “hysteria” to talk about how women could die if Roe v. Wade were overturned. In the 1960s, 200 women per year died after unsafe abortions. We can’t go back. #WhatsAtStake #StopKavanaugh. Stand up and speak out about #WhatsAtStake. On #SCOTUS, Kavanaugh would have power to decimate women’s privacy and overturn #RoevWade, nix protections for preexisting conditions & hand Big Brother and corporations MORE power over individuals. Hiding his background from the American people is unconscionable. HOURS BEFORE THE HEARINGS BEGAN, the Trump admin dropped 42,000 pages of documents on the Senate - only a drop in the bucket! The process @ChuckGrassley’s leading is not advice and consent. It’s a rubber stamp for Trump’s #SCOTUS pick. #WhatAreTheyHiding? The rush job on Kavanaugh’s nomination is another huge Republican attack on political norms and democratic traditions. The Senate has access to only a fraction of Kavanaugh’s documents. How can we hold hearings or cast votes? #StopKavanaugh Have a safe and happy #LaborDay. Today, I'm celebrating American workers and their vital contributions to America. Big thanks to @PDXFire and @SMeieran for joining me today in Portland.pic.twitter.com/IU9Nv1VkWK Untrue.

This bill would let people seeking temporary shelter from wildfire smoke apply for relief under a FEMA program that covers temporary lodging for people who can’t immediately return home after a disaster. I introduced the Clean Air Refugee Assistance Act to help "clean air refugees" - children suffering from asthma, seniors needing respirators to breathe or anybody who’s suffering from unhealthy smoke. Wildfires in Oregon and across the West are getting bigger, hotter and harder to fight. Scientists say they're only getting worse. …  Right now, smoke from wildfires across the West is forcing people to flee their homes for safe haven and a place to breathe - Clean Air Refugees.

Another example of Republicans being for states rights only when they think the state is right. … Kavanaugh has shown again and again that he will side with Big Business and Big Cable against the interests of regular consumers. If you are for REAL #NetNeutrality and a free and open internet, you need to say NO to Kavanaugh. ALL businesses and entrepreneurs have the right to a fair playing field on the internet, and Verizon’s profits are NOT more important than First Responders’ access to unlimited communications services that keep us safe! Kavanaugh’s position goes against a free & open internet. #NetNeutrality means paying your internet access fee, then getting to go where you want, when you want, on the web. Corporations do NOT have 1stamendment rights that trump an individual’s fair access to the internet! Last year, Judge Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion claiming that internet providers have a 1st Amendment right to decide what part of the internet YOU can see. This is bordering on absurdity, and shows that he might not understand what #NetNeutrality actually means. Kavanaugh believes that Comcast and Verizon can decide what you see and where you go online - and that any limit to this power is somehow a violation of their 1st Amendment rights. I joined my @SenateDems colleagues in urging D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to challenge @AjitPaiFCC & the @FCC’s decision to end #NetNeutrality and restore EQUAL access to the internet. … While Trump & congressional Republicans were handing out massive tax breaks to corporations and the top 1% class, 40% of Americans were struggling to make ends meet.

To uncover the whole truth, we must #followthemoney. Michael Cohen's crimes go right to @realDonaldTrump. These crimes helped Trump win the election. Any effort to pardon Michael Cohen or Paul Manafort in and of itself would be a gross assault on the rule of law, and constitute high crimes and misdemeanors.

Trump’s pandering is why we should be wary of anyone who wants the government to regulate content online. … Thanks, @repblumenauer for joining me in demanding #PaperBallotsNOW. #PAVEAct … I had a great conversation with @townhallproject after Saturday’s Clackamas County #2018TownHall meeting.

This is a prescription for endless war. … Trump wants to make it HARDER for working Americans, people of color, young people and Americans with disabilities to vote. The rest of our country should follow Oregon’s lead by offering ALL voters a chance to vote by mail, and automatically registering eligible voters.  American democracy is under attack.  Russia attacked our democracy in 2016 and WILL attack again this year. Congress MUST take action and pass my #PAVEAct to require paper ballots and audits for ALL federal elections. #PaperBallotsNow It’s inexcusable that American democracy depends on hackable voting technology made by a handful of companies that have evaded oversight and stonewalled Congress. … I introduced the #PAVEAct after @SecNielsen told me paperless voting machines are a “national security concern.” The biggest makers of voting machines have REFUSED to answer my basic questions about their cybersecurity practices. #PaperBallotsNOW … Watch election security press conference with @RepBlumenauer, @CommonCause and @busproject LIVE: … Protecting American votes and securing our elections is critical for national security.

I'm glad that federal officials like @SecretarySonny have recognized the critical need for this step by producing this fantastic framework for meaningful and lasting progress. Wildfires are threatening homes & businesses and creating clean air refugees looking for places to breathe,  This plan provides a critical blueprint that will enable local, state, & federal entities to work more efficiently to tackle the growing backlog of hazardous fuels. I'm joining @SecretarySonny and @USDA to announce a new plan for @ForestService to address the hazardous fuels backlog contributing to devastating wildfires in Oregon & the West. Tune in:   … If the United States does NOT step up and fight climate change now, the horrific natural disasters people are seeing today will only get worse. #ClimateAction … .@SecretaryZinke is doing everything he can to ROLL BACK environmental protections and undermine the fight against #climatechange. … Wildfires have gotten so BIG that their plumes of thick, choking smoke are showing up on NASA satellite images from space. Because of #climatechange, megafires are happening routinely and getting bigger. … These wildfires are an economic nightmare for the recreation economy and local business owners who depend on visitors during the summer. … This is the 2nd year in a row that air quality in southern Oregon has ranked among the WORST in the nation. … Currently, there are 100 + large wildfires destroying homes and businesses in communities all across Oregon and the West, burning almost 1.8 MILLION acres. … RIGHT NOW, for people in Oregon & the West, residents are being warned against spending time outside and advised to wear a respirator if needed. Those without homes to provide safe air are being told to seek shelter from the smoke in libraries & gov buildings. CLEAN AIR REFUGEES.pic.twitter.com/1IHebdXI6f Republicans in Congress have been blocking smart forest management policies to line the pockets of clear-cutting cronies. Smart management reduces the risk of megafires AND protects our water & air. We can do both. Today I stand with @SecretarySonny about HOW we are doing both! I’m headed to the floor to join @SenWhitehouse to speak out about the dangers of #climatechange and its impact on the disastrous wildfires in Oregon and the West. Tune In.  … If Trump wins this lawsuit, this would   - Eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions  - Increase premiums for everybody and destroy the individual market  - Eliminate Medicaid for millions of working Americans We must speak out to #ProtectOurCare! … Republicans are lining up behind a #SCOTUS nominee who’s hostile to women’s health care and ready to rubber stamp Trump’s agenda, including taking away your health care. We MUST #StopKavanaugh to #ProtectOurCare. Why are #junkplans bad?  - They let insurance companies lock out people w/ #preexistingconditions - They bring back annual spending caps that hurt people when they get sick - They are filled with loopholes that let insurance companies deny care to families when they need it most. Since @realDonaldTrump took office, he and Republicans in Congress have been sabotaging Americans’ health care NONSTOP – #Junkplans are the most serious attack yet.

While Republicans have been busy chipping away at the foundation that keeps it strong, I’ll go to the mat to keep Social Security safe for generations to come. Today #SocialSecurity turns 83, and it’s more important than ever. Seniors count on Social Security as they face higher and higher out-of-pocket costs for medical care and prescriptions, and it gets harder to put away savings. #SocialSec83 … This administration's trade policy has been a disaster for everyone but Trump's cronies. Looks like they're doing a great job of cashing in for themselves. … These are the corrupt swamp creatures @realDonaldTrump surrounds himself with. … We must #StopKavanaugh and protect #RoevWade and women’s access to health care and privacy. #WhatsAtStake … ICYMI Ranking Member @RonWyden’s report reveals Big Banks would have continued to profit even without massive corporate tax cuts from the #GOPTaxScam.   … … It’s time to require paper ballots and effective audits to secure federal elections from hackers. #PaperBallotsNOW #PAVEAct With insecure electronic voting machines, it’s not a question of if bad guys get in, it’s just a question of when. Congress must pass my #PAVEAct to thwart attacks on our democracy. … Commissioner Glick has a point -- FERC and DOE should enhance grid security, not plot ways to increase utility bills to pay for coal and nuclear subsidies. … More proof of the Trump admin’s war on students - @usedgov provided no legitimate justification for ending policy that protects borrowers from for-profit and career education programs that pile on debt without delivering outcomes. Appalling move by @BetsyDeVosED to help Trump’s cronies get even richer on the backs of defrauded students. … Congratulations to @VirginiaGarcia on the grand opening of their medical center in Beaverton. This amazing new center was years in the making and will greatly expand the vital care VGHMC provides to Washington County. … U.S. intel is warning that foreign actors are actively working to interfere in our elections, but the Trump admin decided to tie the hands of @USTreasury, the ONLY agency with visibility into financial flows of foreign funds into dark-money political orgs. Americans deserve to know whether special interests influenced @stevenmnuchin1 and @USTreasury’s decision to protect dark money groups like the @NRA. … Big Banks are taking this inequity one step further by shuttering branches after receiving windfalls from the #GOPTaxScam. … CEOs are cashing in big on #GOPTaxScam spoils when real wages for hardworking Americans are nearly pancake flat. Where are the $4,000 increases @realDonaldTrump promised? … Not only is @realDonaldTrump's immigration agenda cruel and un-American, it's a surefire way to weaken our economy. … The Collins indictment represents everything Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have stood for since taking office: insiders getting special deals while working Americans are left in the dust.  … .@realDonaldTrump’s plan of indexing capital gains is a $100 BILLION handout to the rich and another broken promise for working Americans. @usatodayopinion … I introduced the #PAVEAct to give Americans the confidence that their votes count, and that election results are free and fair. … We need effective audits and #PaperBallotsNOW to secure our elections and STOP Russia from attacking our democracy. #PAVEAct … Thanks @AARPOR for tonight’s great tele-townhall letting me talk with so many Oregon seniors about important issues like hunger, healthcare and Social Security.pic.twitter.com/B7CUcJ7xjW   They’re gearing up for another attack on your health care. This isn’t going to stop until the American people MAKE it stop. … Republicans in Congress promised a $4,000 raise with the #GOPTaxScam. That hasn’t happened. Now, hard-working Americans will be hit with a nasty tax surprise next year because of underwithholding due to the scam's updated withholding tables. Another promise made, promise broken. … All children need learning opportunities throughout the summer. That’s why I’m working with @SenJeffMerkley on this legislation to provide increased access to books and meals during the summer months to kids in Oregon and nationwide: … I’m proud to help introduce the Census Equality Act to ensure that LGBTQ communities are better represented, and that lawmakers are better equipped to tackle discrimination head on. LGBTQ Americans still face discrimination with employment, housing & the justice system. While the Trump admin undermines LGBTQ rights, the Census Equality Act ensures the approximately 10 million LGBTQ Americans are properly counted in the Census data. … .@SenateGOP is rushing to confirm Kavanaugh to #SCOTUS by keeping his extreme record in the shadows. This battle is not over. We will speak out and fight to #StopKavanaugh.pic.twitter.com/ZIU97tpOWa I joined @SenateDems to speak out against the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh to serve on #SCOTUS.

Today the Senate caved to the White House to let ZTE off the hook. It amounts to selling out American jobs AND American security. I voted NO. Google would be making a hideous mistake by helping China’s authoritarian government censor the internet and suppress dissent. Don’t be evil. The corporate profits aren’t worth it. … #JunkPlans are key to Trump’s plan to return to the bad old days when Americans with pre-existing conditions were left out in the cold & insurance companies could deny care at will or charge whatever they pleased. Trump is giving the green light to #junkplans - once again siding with fraudsters and insurance companies over unsuspecting Americans that simply want affordable health care. #ProtectOurCare … I’m joining @SenateDems at a rally outside the Capitol to speak out against Kavanaugh’s #SCOTUS nomination and his threat to affordable health care, women’s health care rights and individual liberties. #StopKavanaugh WATCH LIVE … I plan to hold all @USTreasury nominees until the Department quits stonewalling our oversight requests. This includes Muzinich if he is reported out of @SenateFinance today. Treasury appointees must exhibit a basic level of candor, a respect for both sides of this committee and know that the department is NOT above the law. Those qualities are lacking at Trump’s @USTreasury. I will be unable to support Muzinich’s nomination for Deputy Secretary. Indexing capital gains is a change plucked from the wish list of the extreme right. Weren’t the $1.5 trillion cash handout from the #GOPTaxScam and the new dark money corruption rule enough?pic.twitter.com/PoYAV07CpB Senate Finance Democrats urged @stevenmnuchin1 and @USTreasury in May to not issue regulations to index capital gains to inflation. This move would inappropriately circumvent Congress in order to benefit the already super-wealthy at the expense of everyone else.pic.twitter.com/MyWYMNvcbE This unilateral action by @stevenmnuchin1 & @USTreasury WOULD almost exclusively benefit the wealthiest Americans, add $100 billion to the ballooning deficit, further complicate the tax code and ignore the need for Congressional sanction. … It’s like the Trump administration offered up a buy-one-get-one deal on handouts for the super-rich. This is a  $100 billion giveaway to the wealthy that produces NO economic benefit. … The Finance Committee meets this morning to vote on the nominations of Justin Muzinich to be Deputy Secretary of @USTreasury and Michael Desmond to be Chief Counsel at IRS. Tune In LIVE:  … The Russians interfered in the 2016 election. There’s a wave of attacks on the horizon. But instead of taking real action, this admin is building sand castles. If you’re not convinced Russia attacked our democracy, @realDonaldTrump, listen to @SecNielsen. … The Russian government’s attack on our election in 2016 was the last straw – Congress must act immediately to protect our democracy from cyberattacks. Withholding tables directly affect the size of American's paychecks. I agree with @USGAO’s recommendation that Treasury and the IRS carefully document any changes made to them. The absence of a paper trail is an opening for future abuse. …  This is an alarm bell for the nearly 30 million households that are expected to owe MORE money come tax time this spring. … Too many Americans are unable to afford the rising cost of premiums & skyrocketing prescription drug prices. I will continue fighting to protect the progress we’ve made to improve our health care system and ensure access to quality & affordable care is a reality for ALL Americans #Medicare & #Medicaid have stood the test of time because Americans understand the value of a health care guarantee. Older Americans and their families should NOT have to second guess whether Medicare will keep its promise when they reach retirement.  This is #junkplans 101. For every dollar you hand to an insurance company, they pocket 66 cents in profit and overhead. Trump wants these rip-offs that masquerade as health care to be the norm. … Americans need to stay active and involved and above all else, vote.  Don’t let Russia or anyone else divide us in order to prop up Trump. These new Facebook ads appear to be from the same Russian election hijacking playbook to keep Americans from voting. Putin is determined to weaken America and ensure his corrupt dictatorship can act with impunity around the world. … Instead of increasing wages for working Americans, this is @realDonaldTrump’s priority. … No more excuses. @HHSgov and @SecAzar have a responsibility to #ReuniteFamilies. … .@PattyMurray, @SenFeinstein and I are raising concerns with @SecAzar about the validity of information from the Trump admin and @HHSgov regarding separated families:  … I agree. Who’s with me? … Helping Russia undermine NATO and letting sanctions-violators off the hook puts American interests in danger. The public has a right to know the truth of what’s behind those decisions. It’s time for Congress to force @realDonaldTrump to #ReleasetheReturns to give the American people the answers they deserve. Congress should not be protecting corruption and keeping Americans in the dark about what’s motivating Trump’s decisions.pic.twitter.com/CLfs0Y9pNA .@realDonaldTrump and Congressional Republicans letting ZTE off the hook after it violated sanctions against Iran and North Korea is a baffling sign of WEAKNESS. Trump’s ZTE deal came right around the time the Trump family secured valuable trademarks and a Trump project in Indonesia got a $500 million loan from a Chinese state-owned company. Americans are left wondering – What does Putin have on Trump? Does Putin have information or financial influence he’s exploiting? Don’t forget – a few weeks ago, @realDonaldTrump attacked our closest allies, threw intelligence officials under the bus and refused to accept Russian interference in the 2016 election – all while putting on a performance next to Putin. RT if you agree that it’s WAY past time for the @realDonaldTrump’s tax returns to be released. #ReleasetheReturns It’s painfully clear that the haze and smoke from wildfires are choking kids, seniors and people in Oregon and throughout the West. Here’s a #RonReport recap of what I heard at a recent wildfire briefing in Medford.pic.twitter.com/weoBEuJgC7 .@realDonaldTrump got millions from China, then he sold out our security. Now Republicans in Congress are greenlighting Trump’s sellout scheme. This is a threat to national security and red, white and blue jobs. … This year, Ranking Member @RonWyden helped pass legislation making #Medicare better for people with chronic illnesses like diabetes, cancer & heart disease. Many states are deciding whether to expand #Medicaid to ensure those in need have a better chance of getting ahead. Republicans tried to cut and slash Medicaid to the bone. Putting Medicaid’s nursing home guarantee, which helps pay for two out of three seniors’ nursing and home-based care, on the chopping block. Care for children, people with disabilities and others at dire risk. #Medicaid53 Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have been busy undermining Medicare and Medicaid’s guarantee. #GOPTaxScam robbed billions of dollars and years of security from Medicare to give massive corporations and their executives big payouts. #Medicare53 Today is the 53rd anniversary of #Medicaid & #Medicare. It’s time to celebrate the vital health care guarantee they provide & a chance to recommit ourselves to protecting them from attacks that threaten their future   #MedicaidWorks #Medicaid53 Election machine manufacturers are resisting meaningful oversight about their security practices, and have deceived the press about the use of remote monitoring software on election equipment. We need to secure our elections NOW #PAVEAct #PaperBallotsNow … Met today in Medford with the great allies of @ppsworegon to discuss our shared goals to protect women’s health.

Innocent children have suffered enough trauma – any further delay is unacceptable. #FamiliesBelongTogether Yesterday, the Senate passed two resolutions I introduced with @SenatorFischer honoring the lives of Grace Hopper and Ada Lovelace, two pioneers who paved the way for the information age. … #TaxScam2 is yet another plan out of the partisan tax playbook to give the rich and high-fliers another round of deficit-exploding tax cuts at a time when typical families are finding it hard to make ends meet. … Republicans are defending the new dark money policy. If your new pro-corruption, pro-secrecy policy gave oligarchs in Moscow reason to throw back celebratory vodkas, you’re doing it wrong. Justin Muzinich is a power-player @USTreasury and he’s up for the #2 job there. The public needs to know if he supports the administration’s new pro-corruption dark-money policy. Oversight from Congress has met unprecedented stonewalling and silence from @USTreasury.

A few times this Congress, one vote shifted and the dominoes started to fall. Last week, an extreme, ideological judge, Ryan Bounds, was blocked by ONE Republican vote.

The #AderholtAmendment creates a #LicensetoDiscriminate and a path for more harm to LGBTQ foster youth. Dangerous House language isn’t just a threat to LGBTQ Americans, it also opens doors to discriminate on marital status or religion. Taxpayer funded child welfare agencies could refuse to serve single parents, divorcees, atheists, agnostics or those of a different faith. The #AderholtAmendment deprives vulnerable children of safe & loving homes. Congress must END taxpayer-funded discrimination and protect the rights of all qualified parents who answer the call to help youth in foster care. #LicenseToDiscriminate BREAKING - I’m leading 39 Senate Democrats in an effort to stop congressional Republicans from promoting discrimination against LGBTQ Americans seeking to be foster or adoptive parents.

Republican leaders tried to throw out 101 years of bipartisan Senate tradition to seat a deeply flawed nominee on the federal bench. Today’s victory was a red-letter day in the Senate. I’m the child of Jewish refugees who fled Nazi Germany. To read what Mr. Bounds wrote was a slap in the face & I imagine there are millions of people across the country who would feel the same way. That’s why @senJeffMerkley & I withheld our blue slips from his nomination. Ryan Bounds flagrantly misrepresented his background, lying to cover up disturbing, intolerant writings from his past & in my view, that means he’s disqualified from sitting on the federal bench. Here’s the bottom line: today, constant pressure against a bad nominee won out. Gratified the Senate came to its senses today & that long-time, proven practices of bipartisanship for judicial nominations > partisan efforts to force through a deeply flawed and compromised nominee. … The American people spoke and we passed our resolution in the Senate with bipartisan support. Now we need to win the House. Call your representatives and let them know what you think about net neutrality. Without real #NetNeutrality, internet startups won’t be able to pay for internet fast lanes that only the big corporations can afford, putting them at a big disadvantage. Real #NetNeutrality ensures an even playing field online, so that small businesses and entrepreneurs can reach customers beyond their city limits and compete with big corporations on the internet. Congress should pass my bill to make every single ballot cast in America a paper ballot to prevent future hacking by Putin and Russia. … .@realDonaldTrump’s credibility has shrunk to ZERO. When it really counted, he didn’t stand up to Putin. It’s time for my Congressional colleagues to stop making excuses for Trump and see him for who he is.pic.twitter.com/kTvPe444Qf For now, because the Trump administration has opened the floodgates to dark money and refused to answer key questions as to why, I will not support the Rettig nomination for IRS commissioner.pic.twitter.com/oVvyMnUNEd What the president calls a “witch hunt” is turning up a lot of witches. No more excuses for Congress to avoid real, bipartisan investigation. Does @realDonaldTrump simply prefer strongmen to democratically-elected leaders, or does Putin have something he’s exploiting? The American people need answers. Enough is enough. It’s time for the Finance Committee to see @realDonaldTrump’s tax returns. His erratic behavior in recent days has raised too many ominous questions. The Trump administration’s pro-corruption dark money policy is dangerously undemocratic. It goes straight to the Hall of Fame of shameless, hackish, partisan politics. … On Monday morning, the public learned about Russia’s devious infiltration of our democracy using a “gun rights organization.” Hours later, on Monday night, the admin’s new dark-money policy made it easier for Russia to get away with it the next time. When the Trump admin. opened the floodgates this week for more foreign dark money to sweep through our democracy, the debate over the future of IRS leadership got a lot more complicated. … When @SenateFinance votes tomorrow on Rettig’s nomination to lead IRS, I will be voting no unless Rettig promises to reverse the Trump admin’s new policy that makes it EASIER for anonymous foreign donors to funnel dark money into political nonprofits. … For @realDonaldTrump to help Putin harass and endanger @McFaul, an American ambassador, would meet my definition of providing aid and comfort to an enemy. … Workers’ wages are falling. Where are the $4,000 wage increases Trump and Congressional Republicans promised? … NEW @SenateFinance report covers a line of broken #GOPTaxScam promises. … My bipartisan, commonsense #HempFarmingAct frees farmers to grow hemp to new heights. Farmers across the country are ready to tap into industrial hemp’s potential. If you can make hemp products and sell them in Oregon, you should be able to grow hemp in Oregon.pic.twitter.com/dSX3zKt0Uf Earlier this month, I had a conversation with hemp farmers and hemp business owners about the bipartisan #HempFarmingAct before touring a hemp processing facility at the Wooden Shoe Tulip Farm in Woodburn.pic.twitter.com/8pDJmz43Xu The first House Republican has joined the House resolution to support real #NetNeutrality and a truly free and open internet. This is not a partisan issue, it is simply common sense. … Ryan Bounds’ nomination process will forever change how judicial nominations are handled. It will further DIVIDE the Congress, and it will further divide the courts along partisan lines. Every member of the Republican conference DEMANDED @SenatorLeahy and President Obama respect the blue slip process in 2009. They did. What Republicans are doing now is HYPOCRITICAL. #CourtsMatter What @ChuckGrassley and @SenateMajLdr have done cheapens the “advise and consent” responsibility of the Senate and hands more power to @realDonaldTrump and the executive branch. It will be an open question whether the current structure of the courts will survive. #CourtsMatter Bounds’ nomination is the FIRST time in the 101-year history of the blue slip process that a nomination moved forward without a blue slip from either home-state Senator. This is extremely disrespectful to the decades-old bipartisan Oregon judicial selection process. #CourtsMatter Several committee members wrote to @SenJeffMerkley and I that if the material had been revealed EARLIER, they would have disqualified Ryan Bounds. Bounds misled the bipartisan committee that reviewed his candidacy. Ryan Bounds only acknowledged what he wrote AFTER it became public and threatened his nomination. He has not recanted the views they reflect. #CourtsMatter Ryan Bounds purposefully withheld disqualifying information from the Oregon bipartisan judicial selection committee. These writings were sexist, racist, and intolerant of the LGBTQ community. I am voting NO on Ryan Bounds’ nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. The nomination of Bounds is a total rejection of the idea of principled bipartisanship. Here’s why  #CourtsMatter LIVE: I’m heading to the Senate floor to speak out against the nomination of Ryan Bounds to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. Tune in. #CourtsMatter … Tomorrow (7/18) at 2pm EDT, join us for Behind the Headlines with special guests Senator @RonWyden and @MaxRichtman.

Beaches, mountains, lakes, rivers, trails – our state has it all. #DiscoverJuly #GetOutside … Installing remote-access software and modems on election equipment is the WORST decision for security short of leaving ballot boxes on a Moscow street corner. Congress MUST pass my bill to require paper ballots and audits. … We need to grow things in America, make things in America, add value to them in America, and then ship them outside of America. To do that, American manufacturers need access to critical minerals. My opening statement at today’s @EnergyDems hearing:pic.twitter.com/DT3SR9XmwW Trump’s chaos strategy on trade threatens access to these critical minerals, and it’ll be American manufacturers and American workers who suffer for it. Imported critical minerals are needed to make solar cells, wind turbines & batteries that are moving our country to a cheaper, low-carbon energy future. They’re essential to creating red-white-and-blue jobs. The clean energy economy alone supports 6.4 MILLION jobs across America The Trump admin is promoting an unfair policy of tariffs on critical minerals that hurts U.S. companies’ ability to compete, while also gutting environmental laws. Keeping China in the driver’s seat puts family-wage jobs, clean air and water at risk. This is why I’ll be opposing Charles Rettig, nominee to be IRS Commissioner unless he commits to restoring this critical IRS disclosure requirement. This is latest attempt by @stevenmnuchin1 and @realDonaldTrump to cover up the facts and keep lawmakers off the #FollowTheMoney trail. …  Trump’s @USTreasury has made it EASIER for anonymous foreign donors to funnel dark money into nonprofits THE SAME DAY a Russian national linked to the @NRA was arrested for trying to influence our elections. Today’s indictment of a Russian national means Republicans can no longer ignore the facts: Russia used @NRA to infiltrate & influence US politics. The Republican leadership should join my investigation & force the @NRA to answer questions about the 2016 election. #FollowTheMoney … Russia attacked our democracy, murders people around the world with impunity, seized territory from a sovereign nation and shot down an airplane full of civilians. But @realDonaldTrump holds "both countries responsible." This is a national embarrassment. .@realDonaldTrump lets Putin lie to his face and doesn't even contradict him. Cannot remember a more blatant display of weakness by a U.S. president. Trump is elevating the authoritarian head of a fascist government. Every word of praise @realDonaldTrump utters for Putin is an endorsement of Russia's attack on our democracy.pic.twitter.com/nVOAy5DbXP That makes two of us. Any others?  … In light of what's been revealed about Russia’s attack on our democracy, the president shaking Putin's hand would be a moment of historic cowardice. Call off this summit, @realDonaldTrump. … Given today's news, I’m reupping my letter to Homeland Security asking what it is doing help defend campaigns against foreign hacking.   … This news makes clear Congress MUST pass my bill to require paper ballots and audits. Anything less is an invitation to Russia to do this again. … .@TheJusticeDept reveals Russia tried to hack election software and equipment companies. But the biggest voting machine companies refuse to answer the most basic questions about whether they are adequately protecting our elections. Cancer. Diabetes. MS. Drug prices for these terrible illnesses continue to go  while @realDonaldTrump stands by and fails to deliver on lower drug prices. Another Trump promise made, promise BROKEN. … This new @SenateFinance report begs one simple question: What are @realDonaldTrump and his administration hiding? … We still don’t know the kind of White House access Cohen was granting to undisclosed clients, or whether Cohen served as a foreign agent. Many of the answers lie in key documents related to #followthemoney issues that @USTreasury refuses to turn over to @SenateFinance. The sweetheart deals & backdoor promises in this report are a snapshot of Michael Cohen’s multi-million dollar side hustle as influencer-in-chief. His secret push to enrich a firm connected to a sanctioned Russian oligarch only raises more questions about the deals he was working … Scientists should be able to teach science without politicians censoring them. #ActOnClimate Today, I joined a resolution w/ @SenWhitehouse to fight Republicans’ attempt to silence scientists and stifle @NSF climate research. It’s critical that meteorologists across the country learn about climate science.pic.twitter.com/2Vrk0vJmwP The #GOPTaxScam = Executives’ pockets NOT workers’ paychecks … Remember when Republicans in Congress said workers would get a $4,000 raise? Now they’re actually FALLING. After the #GOPTaxScam was signed into law, Businesses are spending $700 BILLION on stock buybacks benefiting CEOs and shareholders NOT workers. … Spark your imagination this summer   Read a book  Play a game  Go for a hike  Visit your local library!   Summer is a time to get out there and do! #KeepKidsLearning  All year, students need safe places to learn, build self-esteem and meet friends to keep them on a path to high school graduation. … Celebrate #SummerLearning Day! Every day is an opportunity to learn and grow. Learning programs after school and during the summer months are great ways to keep young people engaged in learning and prevent learning loss. We’ve been hearing this same promise for months. When will there be REAL action for the millions of Americans getting mugged by soaring drug prices at the pharmacy window? … President Trump and @VP promised a Supreme Court nominee who would end vital health care protections for millions of Americans and end women’s reproductive freedom.  It’s no wonder Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh. #WhatsAtStakepic.twitter.com/dkJXwffiRh Also, @RonWyden, @SenFeinstein, @PattyMurray, and I are calling for the removal of ORR Director Lloyd – he is the one largely responsible for these children and his silence is deafening. He must go.pic.twitter.com/iYbh08632j At least 44 million Americans have no choice but to use insecure voting machines that have foreign hackers salivating. Americans must move to paper ballots, marked by hand. Until that system is adopted, every election that goes by is an election that Russia could hack. I testified at the Senate Rules Committee this morning to call on the Senate to pass my Protecting American Votes and Elections Act, which requires paper ballots and effective audits for ALL federal elections.  To secure our elections against foreign hackers, we must have paper ballots and audits. It is inexcusable that American democracy depends on hackable voting machines and technology made by a handful of companies that have evaded oversight and stonewalled Congress.pic.twitter.com/UH0CqnYLu5 .@realDonaldTrump, talk is cheap. Drug prices are not. It’s time for real action - NOT theatrics. .@realDonaldTrump must prove that Pfizer’s announcement is more than theatrics. The American people deserve real change for lower prices at the pharmacy counter. … Secret, sweetheart arrangements with Big Pharma companies are exactly why America’s drug pricing system is broken. Trump and his Admin are busy trying to score cheap PR points while Pharma cos continue to raise prices by DOUBLE digits. … Trump’s health care sabotage crusade is making it harder and harder for families to afford quality insurance that isn’t filled with loopholes and exceptions that benefit insurance companies. Trump wants groups to sell unsuspecting Americans on #junkplans that allow insurance companies to deny care on a whim and charge whatever they want. Nothing but a SCAM. .@CMSgov is cutting the #ACA navigator program. Worse yet, Trump is requiring them to push #junkplans. That's federally-funded fraud. We will NOT return to the days when health care was only for the healthy & wealthy. Democrats & concerned Americans across the country will not stand down without a fight. #WhatsAtStake Americans would face the prospect of “job lock” – developing a condition while at a job, & being stuck there because a new employer couldn't cover their preexisting condition at any cost. Kavanaugh on #SCOTUS would mark an end to protections that ensure employers cover core benefits like prescription drugs, maternity care or pediatric services. Kavanaugh on #SCOTUS means a return to the days when employers could prevent you from getting health care for months, or leave care for your preexisting condition uncovered. #ProtectOurCare #WhatsAtStake The 167 million Americans with employer sponsored health insurance will also lose the #ACA’s airtight, loophole-free preexisting condition protections. #WhatsAtStake If the Senate doesn’t stand up to #StopSCOTUS, @realDonaldTrump will succeed at ripping away preexisting condition protections that affect 130 MILLION people. #WhatsAtStake Why did @realDonaldTrump nominate Judge Kavanaugh? He’s on board with Trump’s agenda of health care discrimination. #WhatsAtStake The health care of ALL Americans with preexisting conditions is gravely threatened by #SCOTUSPick Judge Kavanaugh. #WhatsAtStakepic.twitter.com/56nykr2Tlb If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh would put the #ACA & protections for preexisting conditions on the chopping block. I’m joining @SenateDems to speak out. LIVE  This cruelty is not who we are. The officials responsible for this atrocious behavior must be held accountable. … Innocent children treated like animals, held in freezing “iceboxes.” Parents and kids subjected to sadistic emotional torment. @ICEgov’s conduct is reprehensible. … .@HHSgov and the Trump Admin were ordered to reunite migrant children under 5 years old with their families by TODAY. They’re blowing off the deadline. It’s *unconscionable* that they detained infants and toddlers without a plan to #ReuniteFamilies. … I’m proud to work on legalizing hemp for farmers in Oregon and across the country with the bipartisan #HempFarmingAct in the Senate #FarmBill18. … The @TheJusticeDept Criminal Division must be led by someone independent, experienced and free from Russian connections. Benczkowski isn’t remotely qualified for the job. He has never tried a criminal case. And on the flip side, he represented a major Russian bank.  @SenateGOP is quietly pushing a vote on Brian Benczkowski to lead the @TheJusticeDept Criminal Division. This vote has MAJOR implications for the investigation into Russia’s attack on our democracy. With Judge Kavanaugh as his #SCOTUSPick, @realDonaldTrump has begun a forced march back to the days when women’s health care choices were made by government. We must #StopKavanaugh. #WhatsAtStakepic.twitter.com/6KOMPpQhxS  The Trump administration created this crisis, and it's on them to reunite each and every child with their parents.

Opposing @realDonaldTrump’s nominee for #SCOTUS, Judge Kavanaugh, is going to take massive grassroots people power. Tweet, call your elected officials & make clear #WhatsAtStake. American women could lose the right to chart the courses of their own lives, finding their futures are determined by the whims of fanatical state legislators & the availability of contraception. #CourtsMatter Make no mistake: @realDonaldTrump’s #SCOTUS nomination of Judge Kavanaugh is a direct attempt to overturn Roe v.

The middle class is not going to fall for this new #GOPTaxScam con. Trump’s new tax “postcard” is a smokescreen designed to conceal paperwork, additional calculations & @realDonaldTrump’s broken promise to simplify the tax code. … The #GOPTaxScam was written by Republicans in Congress and the Trump admin to pick favorites and reward the wealthiest CEOs and shareholders – not workers. … Oregon farmers + hops = a recipe to create rural jobs & top-flight craft brews craved around the globe.

It’s critical that Congress has access to ensure conditions are humane and appropriate, even if the policy is not.

No admin should have the power to declare federal, taxpayer-funded facilities off-limits to oversight. … Cosponsored in the Senate by @ChrisVanHollen & @SenSanders, our bill allows members of Congress to fulfill their duty as the eyes and ears of the American people without interference from the executive branch.

Glad to say that’s now happened: … The next time @AjitPaiFCC drops into Oregon, he’s welcome to attend a #2018townhall. I’d like him to hear directly from Oregonians in an open-to-all setting about how much they oppose his reversal of #NetNeutrality. … Americans deserve a health care system that works for everyone. I will keep fighting alongside my friends the @LittleLobbyists to make that a reality and STOP Republican health care sabotage. #ProtectOurCarepic.twitter.com/JUYl0ULpeZ .@realDonaldTrump and Republicans in Congress continue to sabotage Americans’ health care by driving up premiums, undermining pre-existing condition protections & going after Medicaid’s guarantee. Ryan Bounds, nominee for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, claimed that #LGBT Americans liked to “fancy [themselves] oppressed” and therefore see discrimination where it does not exist. Senate Judiciary Democrats voted no.  #PrideMonth #CourtsMatterpic.twitter.com/wbZbpbitf3 Confirming anti-LGBT Trump nominees to the bench is unacceptable and brings our country backwards. #CourtsMatter This is what @realDonaldTrump wants to do to your health care.   Pre-existing condition protections: “gutting.”   Basic safeguards against insurance company greed: “gutted.”   Affordable health care: “gutted.”   It doesn’t get much clearer than that. … ICYMI: Here are 6 terrible truths about the #GOPTaxScam 6 months after the signing. #6MonthsofTaxScam … Senator @RonWyden #CelebratesImmigrants by fighting tirelessly to uphold the humanitarian values that the United States has always stood for. #ImmigrantHeritageMonthpic.twitter.com/8jaVW2iEf0 The House #GOPFarmBill would make it harder for the 1 in 8  Americans who relies on #SNAP to get the food assistance they need. The Senate must fight this heartless attempt to implement paperwork requirements that will force hardworking Americans to go hungry. … The asylum seekers detained at Sheridan’s federal prison MUST have access to legal counsel, representation, clergy and consistent medical care. … The court’s recognition of the fact that digital devices are fundamentally different is a validation of the vital protections against unreasonable search & seizure provided by our Constitution. #SCOTUS #Carpenter This is just the beginning. I’ve argued for years that the sheer volume of information about every single American that's collected by our phones & computers requires a fundamental rethinking of the idea that giving your information to a company means the gov can get it too. BIG win for privacy today. #SCOTUS says the government must get a warrant to search Americans’ location information. #GetAWarrant #Carpenter … This humanitarian crisis is not over. We need answers from @HHSgov & @SecAzar about how the administration will ensure the safety, well-being & reunification of the 2,300+ children who’ve been torn from their families in recent weeks. #ReuniteFamilies My @SenateFinance Democratic colleagues and I are demanding to know @realDonaldTrump and his admin’s plan to reunite children separated from their parents at the border. #ReuniteFamiliespic.twitter.com/RfYiCOu2L8 Congratulations to @Oregon_AFSCME workers on a successful contract w/ @VOAoregon. We need these types of agreements during this time of heightened attacks on workers. … I will continue to urge the highest levels of government to act on my bipartisan bill that cracks down on shell company abuse. The integrity of America’s financial structures are put at risk every day this administration stonewalls.  … .@stevenmnuchin1 gave me a commitment on day one to work with Congress to cut off the flow of dark money. Since then he hasn’t lifted a single finger to help bipartisan legislative efforts advance. … It should be an outrage to anybody who expects honesty from their government that @realDonaldTrump and his advisers won’t even stand up and defend their policy with honest answers. This is a national shame that will be remembered among the dark moments in our history. Many families coming to our country like mine did are seeking asylum and fleeing persecution. They’re facing cruelty and heartlessness from the Trump zero-tolerance policy. There’s no plan to reunite separated families whenever this nightmare ends.pic.twitter.com/iKBTvjeFv3 I’m headed to the Senate floor to speak out against Trump’s zero-tolerance policy and the treatment of asylum seekers in Oregon and at our border. Not all Jewish people were as fortunate. The “America First” movement considered Jews undesirable, and shiploads of Jews fleeing persecution and violence were turned away from the U.S. Many were forced back to Europe and many of them ended up in the concentration camps. On #WorldRefugeeDay, it’s more important than ever to reflect on the humanitarian values our country must uphold for people fleeing persecution. My own parents fled the horrors of Nazi Germany for the safety and promise of the U.S. … People power must keep the pressure on @realDonaldTrump to reverse course on all parts of his inhumane and un-American policies. Here’s an outline of what should and must happen:  … .@realDonaldTrump has made his underlying goals clear: Terrorize innocent refugee families and use them as political pawns to propel a racist agenda. This humanitarian crisis is not over. Locking families in cages together instead of locking children in cages without their parents marks a minor move from total inhumanity to moral bankruptcy. Children DO NOT belong behind bars. America is better than @realDonaldTrump's cruel and callous treatment of asylum seekers that rips apart families and denies them regular medical care or access to legal and spiritual counsel. What I saw at Sheridan was inhumane. … When I visited w/ some of the 123 asylum seekers dumped by the Trump admin at Sheridan federal prison, I heard heartbreaking & harrowing accounts from men fleeing violence in Mexico & Central America about their forced separation from spouses and children. #FamiliesBelongTogether When serious questions about the misuse of charities are raised, @SenateFinance has never ducked. I wrote to Chairman @SenOrrinHatch about the need to investigate these abuses, including the Trump Foundation:pic.twitter.com/K7BiVplHZf UPDATE -- less than a day after I made these letters public, every major wireless carrier says they will cut ties with the middlemen who sell your location information. Chalk one up for oversight and accountability getting results for consumers. It's good news that some of our nation's largest #wireless carriers have announced they are getting out of the business of selling our phone locations to data brokers. But the @FCC still needs to investigate this practice and its impact on consumer #privacy.  So far, crickets. #junkplans send premiums for real, comprehensive health care even higher & leave families without good options. It’s time for the Trump admin and Republicans in Congress to STOP health care sabotage. .@realdonaldtrump and his admin are opening the floodgates for #junkplans that make it harder for people with pre-existing conditions to find affordable coverage & easier for scam artists to make a quick buck at the expense of American families. While @Verizon & @ATT have now pledged to stop selling customer location data to shady middlemen, @TMobile & @sprint seem content to keep selling customers’ private information, Americans’ privacy be damned. After my investigation revealed abuses, @Verizon & @ATT pledged to stop selling Americans’ location data to shady middlemen. … For some asylum-seekers, information about contacting lawyers had been left in their clothes, but their clothes weren't with them. America was built on respecting individual rights. There was no respect here. The asylum seekers I met at Sheridan's federal prison on Saturday have been lumped together and then dumped into prison. Some have been separated from their families. This needs to stop NOW. #KeepFamiliesTogetherpic.twitter.com/eiH13Rzl7i This is WRONG, @SecNielsen, YOU can stop this inhumane treatment right now. … .@realDonaldTrump's grotesque trampling on human rights must have zero place in America and in Oregon. #FamiliesBelongTogether … When I visited Sheridan's federal prison on Saturday, I talked to a father whose 18-month-old daughter was torn from him and now, he doesn't know where she is. .@realDonaldTrump has chosen a policy to rip asylum-seeking families apart and imprison children in metal cages. We cannot stand for this. #KeepFamiliesTogether … #Oregon Sen. @RonWyden: “What we saw over the last hour demonstrates that the Trump ‘zero tolerance’ policy makes zero sense and shows zero understanding of American values.”  Press conference with @ThinkLawLab and @ACLU_OR  LIVE … Tune in to my press conference with @ThinkLawLab and @ACLU_OR LIVE to hear what we’ve learned and actions going forward. #FamiliesBelongTogether This afternoon, I met with @ThinkLawLab and @ACLU_OR to discuss what we’ve learned about the treatment of asylum seekers at the federal prison in Sheridan. #FamiliesBelongTogether What @SenJeffMerkley, @RepBonamici and @repblumenauer and I saw in Sheridan’s federal prison demonstrates that the Trump 'zero tolerance' policy makes zero sense and shows zero understanding of American values. #FamiliesBelongTogetherpic.twitter.com/zWCLlYigQ0 .@realDonaldTrump’s choice of zero tolerance for the refugees we met today & for the others imprisoned around the country this #FathersDay weekend makes zero sense & shows zero understanding of American values. #FamiliesBelongTogether America must stand as the beacon of hope that welcomed our immigrant ancestors and creating the future we want for our children. #KeepFamiliesTogether My parents found refuge in America when they fled the terrors of Nazi Germany. @realDonaldTrump’s cruel and callous treatment of human beings seeking asylum is unconscionable and flies in the face of America’s humanitarian values. #KeepFamiliesTogether I just visited with asylum seekers at Federal Correctional Institution in Sheridan. What I saw and heard today highlights the urgency of reversing @realDonaldTrump’s immoral, dangerous and traumatizing actions.pic.twitter.com/OUcIrmiIis I just visited asylum seekers at the Federal Correctional Institution in Sheridan with @SenJeffMerkley, @RepBonamici and @repblumenauer. Watch our press conference. #FamiliesBelongTogether … The grotesque Trump treatment - lumping detainees together, separating children from parents and dumping human-beings like waste into prisons. #FamiliesBelongTogether Separating kids and parents is fundamentally evil. These aren’t American values. #FamiliesBelongTogether Just sat down w/ @RonWyden about this. We'll be live streaming the press conference later today... … The Trump treatment of refugees cannot stand. This is inhumane. I stand with @ACLU_OR. … ICYMI: my interview with Senator @RonWyden this morning. We talked about @realDonaldTrump’s Zero Tolerance Policy, election hacking, Paul Manafort, Oregon wildfires, hemp and Pride Weekend.  … But like other Trump trade actions, I'm concerned it was more impulsive than strategic. Since @realdonaldtrump took office, China has only imposed more trade barriers & NAFTA talks are on life support. China’s unfair, disruptive trade tactics are an assault against American workers and American innovation. Workers need results. If today’s action marks the beginning of a coherent strategy that produces real change in China, I welcome it. The Trump administration is raising #healthcare costs for millions of Americans and attacking protections for people with pre-existing conditions that @RealDonaldTrump promised to protect.   Senate Dems are fighting back.pic.twitter.com/LGEXD50AJk Huge congrats to @OregonState for earning this opportunity from the @NSF to build this key addition to our country’s academic research fleet. … Congress must take action and pass the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act to stop the Trump administration’s inhumane policy of separating families. #FamiliesBelongTogetherpic.twitter.com/y6lNZ26im2 Children belong with their families, NOT in detention centers or tent cities. Separating families at the border runs counter to our American and humanitarian values. This is not who we are as Americans. #FamiliesBelongTogether Inhumane and cruel - @realDonaldTrump administration’s treatment of innocent children who’ve been torn from their parents’ arms only succeeds in further traumatizing them. #FamiliesBelongTogether … Ripping a baby from its mother's breast is fundamentally evil. … The only relationships @realDonaldTrump doesn't blow up are those with repressive regimes that line his pockets.pic.twitter.com/jG4qHElk6H What’s worse than @realDonaldTrump breaking his promise to increase wages by $4,000?  Americans watching their wages shrink under #TrumpTax. … We must protect Medicaid access. Oregon’s rural communities depend on it. In Wallowa County’s 7,000 person population, nearly 2,000 rely on Medicaid, many gaining coverage thanks to Oregon’s #MedicaidExpansion. #OregonWay After my Wallowa County town hall last month, I met w/ Dr. Elizabeth Powers, a family physician at Winding Waters, about the impact of #MedicaidExpansion in Eastern OR & how #CommunityHealthCenters & preventative care have helped residents achieve their health goals. #OregonWaypic.twitter.com/rYKG4S0oJo This is astounding. @FERC commissioner told me that @SecretaryPerry’s proposal would raise energy rates between $32 BILLION and $65 BILLION total. That's $250 - $500 per family without a single added benefit.  … Don’t take it from me. Number crunchers confirm Trump’s campaign of sabotage is driving up your premiums. … Americans deserve a health care system that works for everybody – not just the healthy and wealthy. Trump and his Republican allies appear to believe otherwise. The Trump admin wants to roll back the clock: First, they tried to eliminate the Medicaid guarantee & hurt seniors. Then they opened the door to #junkplans. Now, they want to let insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions ranging from ovarian cancer to asthma. After Republicans failed to pass #Trumpcare through Congress, they’ve been looking for any possible way to subvert the will of the American public, who stood up and spoke out against their regressive plans. When @realDonaldTrump and his Justice Department abandoned their duty to defend the law of the land, they put the health care of 130 million Americans with a pre-existing condition at risk. It’s another example of Trump’s health care agenda of discrimination.pic.twitter.com/Xl5rYRY3AK Great to see my friend JD and some of Oregon’s brightest ambulance stars with the 2018 @amerambassoc #StarsofLife!pic.twitter.com/HScxqxriW6 The World Cup is a celebration of culture, diversity and sport that brings people from all over the world together.

Hosting the world’s biggest soccer tournament is a boost to American jobs and sports, which is why I supported their bid. #United2026  … My bipartisan #HempFarmingAct w/ @SenateMajLdr, @SenJeffMerkley and @RandPaul will help farmers unlock the full economic potential of industrial hemp, spurring economic growth and creating good-paying red, white, and blue jobs in rural communities across the country. I’m thrilled the bipartisan #HempFarmingAct passed the #SenateAg committee today. This marks a huge step toward allowing consumers to buy products made in America with hemp grown in America. #FarmBill18 … Thanks, @repblumenauer. Glad to have you as a partner on the Protecting American Votes & Elections Act. Congress must act immediately to protect our elections. … Americans with pre-existing conditions already struggle with periods of uninsurance. @realDonaldTrump wants to make it even harder for them to get the care they need and deserve.pic.twitter.com/rITHX3zSvc .@realDonaldTrump wants to get rid of pre-existing condition protections - that puts over HALF of Americans under 65 at risk of being denied by an insurance company - 67 MILLION women and girls and 66 MILLION men and boys, according to @HHSgov.pic.twitter.com/jiA0QYaXCy .@realDonaldTrump can’t just deny detainees their rights to legal counsel or to talk with their families. That’s why I am working with my colleagues in the Oregon delegation to fight back: … Leaving the fate of America’s democracy up to hackable election machines is like leaving your front door open, unlocked and putting up a sign that says ‘out of town.’ It’s not a question of if bad guys get in, it’s just a question of when. For Americans to have confidence that their votes count, and that election results are free and fair, there absolutely have to be paper ballots and mandatory audits for each and every federal election. I’m proud @SenGillibrand, @SenMarkey, @SenJeffMerkley, @PattyMurray and @SenWarren are joining in introducing legislation to require state and local governments to take basic steps to secure elections from hackers, & ensure every American’s vote counts. Russia’s attack on our democracy in 2016 was the last straw – Congress must act immediately to protect our democracy from cyberattacks. I’ve introduced the Protecting American Votes & Elections Act to mandate paper ballots & risk-limiting audits in all federal elections. Two years ago 49 lives were tragically taken at the #Pulse Nightclub shooting. Today and throughout #Pride month, we #HonorThemWithAction to end anti-LGBTQ violence, hatred and discrimination. … Glad there’s action on my request to increase resources for the Rural Health Care program that’s so vital to rural Oregon. The time is now for the @FCC to pass this proposal. … I fought this proposal before and I will continue to fight this corrupt scheme to bail out coal barons and swindle American families. Oregon has a 50% target for renewable power by 2040, and our utilities are working with the state to make it happen. That is what the future should look like. The Trump admin is reaching into Americans’ pocketbooks only to hand that hard-earned money to mismanaged utilities and uncompetitive coal companies, many of whom are Trump donors. The Trump administration’s commonsense-defying plan will raise utility rates for consumers from $30 billion to $65 billion - The average family will pay between $250 - $500 more per year for NOTHING, because this plan will not make the grid more secure or more reliable. .@SecretaryPerry & @realDonaldTrump are propping up their coal cronies at the expense of American families. Their absurd, unnecessary scheme to subsidize uncompetitive coal plants will raise your electric bill by $250 - $500 a year.pic.twitter.com/UWS4LacGdf I’m standing with my Democratic colleagues as we work to pass the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act to put an END to the Trump administration’s policy of intentional cruelty to children and families. #FamiliesBelongTogether My own parents fled persecution in Nazi Germany. They were among the lucky ones who were allowed in as America turned away boatloads of Holocaust refugees. #FamiliesBelongTogetherpic.twitter.com/ZRe9iXdW1i The Trump admin’s policy of tearing children out of their parents’ arms at the border is inhumane & goes against American values. Punishing families for risking everything to escape the violence and horror of their home countries is NOT what built America. #FamiliesBelongTogetherpic.twitter.com/UvQpVHgZ6T Hunger never takes the summer off. It’s vital we provide safe places for young people to have meals and learn during the summer months. Let’s put an end to #SummerLearningLoss and #EndHunger by supporting @OregonASK and other crucial summer programs. … The Trump administration is already driving up your healthcare premiums.

Now, that it's done, take a look back at what he told us.pic.twitter.com/pBPmALPwv7 When your rates go up, or it costs more to access your favorite streaming service, or you have to pay more for the same internet speed – thank Trump’s @FCC. Everyone should have a level playing field online. It’s time for the House to #SaveTheInternet and bring our #NetNeutrality resolution to the floor for a vote. To #SaveTheInternet, the Senate passed a resolution to protect #NetNeutrality and give communities, students and businesses equal access to information. Today, @realdonaldtrump’s @FCC new rules go into effect, ending a free & open internet by allowing the creation of fast lanes for the wealthy and slow lanes for the rest of us. #SaveTheInternet I'm excited to see what benefits @TMobile can bring to my home state, and places like Mitchell, Oregon, by ensuring they have access to wireless broadband internet. More broadband deployment can revolutionize business, healthcare, and improve information access throughout rural Oregon and the rest of the U.S. I applaud @TMobile for prioritizing these communities.  … That information doesn’t need to come at the expense of privacy. My bipartisan bill w/ @SenRubioPress & @MarkWarner uses advanced encryption to promote transparency in #HigherEd while protecting sensitive data. I welcome this news from @NAICUtweets: … With the rising cost of college, Americans looking to get a #HigherEd degree need access to better information to help them make the right decisions about their education & financial futures. … Proud to stand with @MultCo as its leaders fight yet another discriminatory, ideological maneuver by the Trump administration to devastate equitable access to health care. … Health care is a right - not something reserved for the healthy and wealthy. @realDonaldTrump and his Republican allies appear to believe otherwise. After multiple failed attempts to repeal the #ACA, this is the ultimate act of health care sabotage. .@realDonaldTrump & his admin have asked the courts to let insurance companies to deny care, charge more, and discriminate against the 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions - everything from cancer to asthma. .@USTreasury is stonewalling @SenateFinance’s request for financial details about Novartis’s business dealings with Michael Cohen. What exactly was Novartis trying to get for their $1.2 million payment? @maddowpic.twitter.com/IR2kOWUFq9 There are no justifications for this action by @realDonaldTrump that benefit the American people. There are several benefits for Trump personally.pic.twitter.com/iupvAGliYp What better time to secure the #HempFarmingAct in the #FarmBill than #HempHistoryWeek  My bipartisan legislation with @SenateMajLdr would end America’s outdated anti-hemp laws so American consumers can buy products made with hemp grown in America. I’ll keep working with our bipartisan cosponsors - @SenJeffMerkley & @RandPaul - to pass our bill into law. I’m proud my bipartisan #HempFarmingAct is included in the Senate #FarmBill. Hemp is a job-creating growth industry with far-reaching economic potential. It’s common sense that farmers in Oregon and across the U.S. should be allowed to cultivate this cash crop.pic.twitter.com/a5tVo3ctGs It’s been a hard week with news about the increasing numbers of suicides in the U.S. If you want to learn more about what to do if someone comes to you expressing thoughts of wanting to hurt themselves, please enroll in a Mental Health First Aid Course.  You’re not alone.

Even in our darkest times, we can find light.  The Trump admin’s decision to separate children from parents at the border is cruel, unnecessary & goes against our American values. Our government has a humanitarian duty to the children & families seeking asylum in the U.S. to end this policy immediately. #KeepFamiliesTogether Today, I led 39 of our Democratic colleagues in demanding @realDonaldTrump and his admin stop further traumatizing children and end their new inhumane policy of separating innocent children from families who cross the Southwest border seeking asylum. #KeepFamiliesTogetherpic.twitter.com/c3H4ZSeJLW Thanks, @nature_oregon! Our bipartisan #firefix is great news for Oregon and communities across the West. … The only question is whether this was the price of Ivanka’s trademarks and the $500 million loan to an Indonesia Trump development. .@realDonaldTrump & congressional Republicans must reverse this decision before it’s too late. Trump is making America less safe by creating jobs in China and securing nothing for American workers in return. #BlockTheDeal A loser deal for American security & American workers. @realDonaldTrump & his admin are giving ZTE & China the green light to spy on Americans & sell U.S. tech to North Korea & Iran - as long as it pays a fine that’s only tiny fraction of its revenue. … Today, more than a quarter of the Senate – Democrats & Republicans – have signed on to our #HempFarmingAct to end this brainless, anti-farmer, anti-American jobs policy. Momentum is growing, and I am not going to stop looking for every opportunity to make progress on this issue. Hemp is a HUGE opportunity for American farmers and red, white and blue jobs – which is why @LeaderMajLdr, @SenJeffMerkley, @RandPaul & I intro’d the #HempFarmingAct in April – the latest version of legislation I’ve intro’d every Congress since 2012. #HempWeek Hemp = The only Schedule I controlled substance you can sew into a tee shirt and wear through TSA. #HempWeek Hemp = NOT a drug. Having one too many hemp granola bars might give you a stomach ache, but it won’t put you in the hospital. It defies common sense that our laws consider hemp to be as dangerous and addictive as meth. #HempWeek Hemp products make up a $1 BILLION industry in the U.S. - Hemp growers in Canada and China are laughing their way to the bank, while hemp farmers at home have their hands tied with restrictions on growing this Schedule I controlled substance. #HempWeek Products made with hemp are perfectly legal, but growing industrial hemp is a federal crime. It’s simple - If you can buy hemp products in a supermarket in America, farmers should be able to grow it in America. #HempWeek  Happy #HempWeek! I’m headed to the Senate floor to speak in celebration of #HempHistoryWeek and to encourage my Senate colleagues to end the anti-farming restrictions on growing industrial hemp. Children are telling us they’re afraid to go to school because of gun violence. What could be more important for the Federal Commission on School Safety than addressing guns in schools? … This is a farce. … .@realDonaldTrump is delivering jobs for China at expense of U.S. national security. Launching trade wars with our allies and days later capitulating to China. This Administration’s feckless China policy will be a disaster for American economic & national security. #BlockTheDeal The charitable deduction is a lifeline—not a loophole. According to the nonpartisan @TaxPolicyCenter, #TrumpTax will cut the number of middle-income Americans claiming the charitable deduction by two-thirds.  …pic.twitter.com/o74m9CFqhm #TrumpTax set charitable groups up to fail. If this lack of giving continues, organizations will be forced to shutter their doors and leave the communities they serve with nowhere to turn. … I agree. @realDonaldTrump is a coward for pretending his policy of cruelty is required by law. … The fact that Manafort feels free to engage in witness tampering, while being watched by federal authorities, raises questions about whether @realDonaldTrump promised Manafort he would never face justice.pic.twitter.com/vWxvTPKrSC This report eliminates any doubt that the #TrumpTax yanked Medicare closer to insolvency. Between reviving #junkplans, sending premiums skyrocketing & doing serious damage to Medicare’s finances, Trump’s rap sheet on health care gets worse by the day. … Oregonians know all too well that you can’t eliminate fires, but our bipartisan #FireFix, coupled with smart use of air tankers and all wildfire fighting tools, can lessen wildfires’ catastrophic effects in Oregon & across the West. In this morning’s @EnergyDems hearing, I asked Interim @forestservice Chief Christiansen how the Forest Service will ensure air tankers will be available to quickly and effectively fight fires this wildfire year.pic.twitter.com/I5AHH4hGDF My bipartisan #FireFix with @MikeCrapo is the law of the land. The @forestservice needs to get back in the woods and restart fire prevention projects to save lives. I heard Oregonians’ ongoing concerns last week at #2018townhalls about another significant wildfire year facing the West. Lives are at stake, and the @forestservice must do everything it can on fire prevention and suppression. No US ally should ever jail people for voicing political opinions. Bahrain must release Nabeel Rajab and others. … The Trump administration doesn’t have a solution to hold drug makers accountable. A bill I wrote, the SPIKE Act, would require drug companies to justify their exorbitant price hikes to the public. No more excuses while costs climb higher and higher.   … Surprise, surprise - Even with drug rebates built in, high drug prices are clobbering taxpayers and consumers.   …pic.twitter.com/bm1mWdCnr4 In Medicare’s prescription drug program, Americans paid more and got less. The people happiest about it sit in Big Pharma board rooms.    …pic.twitter.com/nNai6P5Vay In this memo, @realDonaldTrump blows past the rule of law and says he is the state. … Proud to call Commissioner Hall a long-time friend.

Congress must act to protect LGBTQ rights - discrimination for any reason remains discrimination. #OpenToAll Discriminating against anybody because of how they look, who they love or who they are has no place in our country. #OpenToAll #MasterpieceCakes … Tough draw for @timbersfc today but I still enjoyed the best fans in MLS and getting to hang out with @TimberJoey. #rctidpic.twitter.com/FS8mtsFsNf It’s past time for Congress to create real solutions and stop normalizing gun violence. #Enough It was insightful listening to @march4portland leaders this afternoon share their ideas for addressing gun violence in our communities and schools.

It is high time for the @FCC and the Trump admin to act immediately to protect American national security. … .@DHSgov told me there may be a rogue cellphone spying device near the White House, and yet reports say the president doesn’t even use a secure phone to protect his calls. … Proud to #WearOrange today in solidarity with Americans of all ages and backgrounds working every day to reduce our country’s epidemic of gun violence. Congress must step up & take common-sense steps toward curbing gun violence in America.pic.twitter.com/47LyJ9Ud3z I called on the @Energy Department last fall to abandon these schemes to prop up the coal industry at the expense of American families. It was a corrupt idea then, and it’s a corrupt idea now. … It's bad enough gas prices have already risen under the Trump administration, but now @SecretaryPerry is planning to blow up energy markets & raise utility rates to pad the wallets of his coal executive friends. … Heard today at @STCHealth in Bend from providers of rural health care in Oregon — and from @OHSUNews via teleconference — about the importance of reliable broadband to telemedicine that’s key to quality healthcare throughout our state.pic.twitter.com/ZjNARw9Q5h Instead of leading our allies to confront China's unfair trade and investment practices,  @realDonaldTrump has united our allies to confront the United States. … Great to meet yesterday in Bend with so many of the innovative leaders who are building the High Desert into a high-tech center that’s renowned nationally and globally.pic.twitter.com/PX3aPAsDlh Enjoyed today’s #2018townhall in Paisley & hearing from Lake County students & adults about common-sense solutions that can generate rural jobs, reduce gun violence, restore #NetNeutrality and more.pic.twitter.com/lLIPi8VJeY To date, the Trump admin appears to be pursuing a trade policy that creates economic chaos and uncertainty rather than jobs for hard working Americans. The U.S. needs to take tough, immediate action to fight back against China’s predatory policies, and bring back American steel and aluminum jobs. But these tariffs, on the very allies we need to pressure China, make no sense. The road to @OregonSB winning the #WCWS and bringing the title home to Eugene begins this morning. #GoDucks Looking forward very much to today’s Lake County #2018townhall in Paisley and tomorrow’s Crook County #2018townhall in Prineville. Details of both open-to-all town halls are here:  Thanks to the health clinic staff at North Eugene High School for all the great work you do every day for students and for taking the time to educate me today.pic.twitter.com/LRVdDXwjQp Thanks to the #TrumpTax, major corporations have announced $450 BILLION in stock buybacks – schemes that enrich CEOs and foreign shareholders and leave workers in the lurch. As we head into the warm summer months, I’m hearing from Oregonians concerned about the upcoming fire season. I’ve urged the @forestservice chief & will continue to press the agency to make sure air tankers are available when & where they are needed to fight fires this year. The Trump administration’s inhumane new policy of separating immigrant families as a way to deter people from coming to the United States undermines our values as Americans. This policy of cruelty must end. #KeepFamiliesTogether … Heard fresh ideas today from the impressive students at North Eugene HS to solve long-time stalemates over gun violence, #DACA, #NetNeutrality, graduation rates & more. #ListeningToTheFuturepic.twitter.com/LxyODcxTOG I’ve been pushing the @FCC for more than a year to force phone companies to secure their networks. Foreign surveillance companies like this one openly advertise powerful spying tech, which they sell to governments around the world … .@AjitPaiFCC seems to be more interested in protecting his friends at the wireless carriers than protecting Americans. The @FCC can & should conduct an independent assessment of the security of U.S. phone networks, identity which networks are lagging behind, & then force those companies to up their security. If more consumers knew how easily bad guys can track or hack their mobile phones, they’d demand the @FCC & wireless companies do something. … Big thanks to the @RedCrossCasc responders from Oregon and SW Washington going to help the people of Hawaii affected by the Kilauea volcano. … Don’t forget - While @realDonaldTrump praised Vladmir Putin, Russia plotted with the OPEC oil cartel to drive up oil prices and gouge Americans at the pump. … I can’t see any rhyme or reason to the Trump admin’s erratic policy shifts. A week ago @stevenmnuchin1 announced that the tariffs were off. Over the weekend, the Trump admin went ahead with its plan to save Chinese jobs at ZTE - a company violating Iran & North Korean sanctions. Another day, another trade announcement. But it still doesn’t look like @realDonaldTrump and his admin really intend to crack down on China. After #2018TownHalls and #MemorialDay services in Eastern and Southern Oregon, I’m headed to the Multnomah County Courthouse for jury duty this morning. Jury duty is the heart of our justice system.  #RonReportpic.twitter.com/2UOB4OU47O On this #MemorialDay and every day  @Lines_for_Life supports veterans with their Military Help Line. #ORVets … So honored to be at Eagle Point National Cemetery in Southern Oregon this afternoon on #MemorialDay to pay tribute to the brave lives lost while making the ultimate sacrifice for our country.pic.twitter.com/mn1bLmjBFx Started the morning in Central Point at the Oregon Fallen War Heroes Memorial this #MemorialDay to honor the brave Americans who made the greatest sacrifice for our country and freedoms.pic.twitter.com/MR0gX08A1C On this #MemorialDayWeekend, it was great visiting with Oregon veterans in The Dalles at the Oregon Veterans Home - and hearing how I can continue to advocate for and support veterans and seniors. #ORVetspic.twitter.com/5j7gd0YZ1e Oregonians shouldn’t have to drain their wallets to fill up their tanks. I stopped by a Trump gas pump in Eastern Oregon where gas prices are skyrocketing. @realDonaldTrump’s reckless decision to break our deal with Iran has only added to the spike in pump prices and created massive uncertainty in oil markets. #RonReportpic.twitter.com/pDcEATrYS0 Huge thanks, Wallowa County for a strong turnout this #MemorialDayWeekend in Joseph for today’s #2018townhall. Great #OregonWay conversation about issues affecting Eastern OR & our country including health care access, drug prices, LGBTQ rights, #publiclands & affordable housing.pic.twitter.com/7Bq7ttUZHl As Oregonians prepare to mark today’s anniversary of the horrific MAX attack in Portland, it's unfortunate that the Senate-passed resolution honoring the heroes of that day remains blocked by Republican leadership in the House. … By repealing #NetNeutrality, what @AjitPaiFCC really wants is a wish list for the deep pockets of the information aristocracy and a path to digital serfdom. … My thoughts are with the victims of today’s horrific hit-and-run in downtown Portland. Big thanks to the first responders who came to the scene. Moved by today’s visit to the beautiful memorial at Portland’s Hollywood Transit Center honoring the heroes who stood up bravely to domestic terrorism in last May’s horrific MAX attack.pic.twitter.com/y5q6iKZ28N With strong #NetNeutrality allies like @RepBonamici , @Jennifer_for_OR, @SMeieran and @MultCoLib_Dir, people power can prevail in the U. S. House on net neutrality just as it did in the U.S. Senate.pic.twitter.com/6xiWQDQJM9 Heard from Oregonians today in Portland at the @MultCoLib branch in Hillsdale about the urgent need to restore #NetNeutrality.pic.twitter.com/EaHywzh4AJ American workers remain hostage to China's rampant unfair trade practices while the Trump Administration lets ZTE off scot-free for cheating on Iran and North Korea sanctions.  What happened to America First?   … China has done less than nothing for us on trade. Why is this administration working so quickly to save jobs at a Chinese tech company?  Glad that Donald Trump has finally recognized what history & common sense could have told him months ago before he launched this misguided BPA privatization scheme that would’ve hurt NW ratepayers: … As I have seen and heard firsthand from meeting #DACA students across Oregon, DREAMers like Paola Amaral of @Nyssa_Bulldogs work hard and make their communities better places:   … Trump needs to stop lobbying for payoffs to Big Oil executives and focus on helping regular Americans – starting by urging the OPEC oil cartel to stop inflating gas prices. .@realdonaldtrump’s reckless decision to break our deal with Iran has only added to the spike in oil prices, and created massive uncertainty in oil markets that translates to more pain at the pump for drivers. Any tax benefit working families might have seen from Trump’s law will be wiped clean by the rise in gas prices. 7 of the largest Big Oil companies announced $13 billion in stock buybacks after Trump signed his #TrumpTax bill into law. These schemes fatten the wallets of wealthy CEOs & shareholders worldwide - NOT working Americans.  Since @realDonaldTrump took the wheel, he’s driven gas prices in one direction – straight up. Gas prices have risen more than 25% since Trump took office, hitting an average of nearly $3 a gallon nationwide. It’s hard to imagine a more important duty at the #FAA than ensuring passenger safety. I’m demanding answers from the FAA about its delay in addressing safety concerns ahead of the fatal @SouthwestAir flight.pic.twitter.com/AACd0U4ph0 I wrote to @FBI Director Wray: “The FBI is struggling with basic arithmetic – clearly it should not be in the business of dictating the design of advanced cryptographic algorithms.”  … The @FBI said it couldn’t break into 7800 encrypted phones. The real number is actually below 1/6th of that - or even less. .@realDonaldTrump and his administration don’t want to let your doctor tell you the truth about your health care options. … The U.S. spent $3.5 TRILLION on health care last year. With that kind of $ going into health care in this country, it must be possible to guarantee rural Americans aren’t on the outside looking in.pic.twitter.com/4Q3McDSFZQ Since 2010, 83 rural hospitals have closed services, and hundreds more are in dire conditions. We must prevent rural America from turning into that sacrifice zone where people can’t get the care they need. Rural areas feel like their local hospitals are already teetering on the brink of closing their doors. If they lose their local hospital, the emergency department goes with it. Rural communities feel like there’s a wrecking ball headed their way because the @realDonaldTrump, his admin & Congressional Republicans have spent the last 15 months desperately trying to make huge cuts to Medicaid - a lifeline for rural hospitals and patients. When I hold open-to-all town hall meetings in every rural Oregon county, I meet with many leaders from the rural health care community and Oregonians who depend on quality care. The #TrumpTax has Harley-Davidson shareholders riding all the way to the bank – at the expense of its workers and their communities. … Find the full list of my @SenateFinance colleagues’ bills here:  … I’m proud to announce with my @SenateFinance colleagues 22 bipartisan Medicare, Medicaid and Human Services bills that take a significant step forward in finding a lasting fix. Congress must take real and lasting action to confront the growing opioid epidemic that’s devastated far too many people and their loved ones in Oregon and across the country. This is an attack on @PPFA & an attack on vital sources of care for women. Women could lose access to the doctors they trust & to life-saving services like cancer screenings, routine physicals, as well as birth control & prenatal care. Republicans in Congress used to talk about “patient-centered care.” What they really put into action is politics-centered care. Limiting health care choices for women is wrong. @realDonaldTrump’s administration is putting itself right in the middle of women and their doctors, denying access to critical information millions of women rely on from the physicians and providers they trust.pic.twitter.com/QCtO5fJiwO When so many Oregonians can’t afford a roof over their heads, our entire community suffers. With rent & housing costs soaring in OR, this much-needed public housing funding will help ensure the availability of this basic necessity all Oregonians deserve. … The bottom line - A woman’s ability to access the health care she deserves and make informed decisions about her body should be an unimpeachable right. We must fight against this attack on women’s health care. .@realDonaldTrump wants to put the government in charge of what conversations doctors can have with their patients and which health care services women can receive - That’s as ‘Big Brother’ as it gets. Stock buyback schemes boost CEO pay by inflating stock prices – but Big Oil execs on this stock buyback spree are already out-earning their average employees by up to 935 times. Since Trump signed his tax law, 7 of the biggest oil companies have announced stock buybacks totaling $13 BILLION.  … Big Oil CEOs are funneling their #TrumpTax cuts into BILLIONS of dollars into stock buybacks. Oil execs and foreign shareholders are raking in these big benefits while working families watch prices at the pump skyrocket. By giving corporations a permanent tax cut, the #TrumpTax is giving Big Oil major tax windfalls year after year. Over the next decade, 4 of the biggest oil companies are estimated to rake in nearly $15 BILLION in tax benefits. .@SenateFinance staff analyzed Big Oil earnings calls and financial documents that exposed how #TrumpTax set up Big Oil to rake in billions and billions of dollars in tax benefits over the next decade.  … Diversity of skills & backgrounds is what makes our country a powerhouse of innovation. This draft legislation is an important first step toward helping businesses harness the immense brainpower, talent and economic potential the American workforce has to offer. My draft ELEVATE Act will help workers access on-the-job training and support services like child care & transportation, allowing more workers to succeed and stay on the job, helping their families, their employers & their communities thrive.  … According to @USDOL, there’s a job opening for every American who needs work. The reality is that folks who are out of work want a job. But more needs to be done to connect Americans to good-paying jobs & help everyone climb the economic ladder. Unemployment is at a post-recession low, but there’s still a huge gap between current job openings & workers needing good jobs. I’m announcing a proposal to fund employment programs to narrow the workforce gap and help more Americans find work & support. … It's high time for the government to drop this misguided effort, which will only make Americans less safe from criminals, hackers and predators. … Politicians have been pushing for years to put government backdoors in Americans' phones and computers, apparently, based on wildly inflated statistics. What do Americans get in return for @realDonaldTrump saving Chinese jobs at ZTE?pic.twitter.com/AxIgoJkWQ3 After months of fruitless trade negotiations, it’s stunning to see how rapidly the Trump administration sprang into action to save these jobs at ZTE, a Chinese firm that schemed to use shell companies to violate our sanctions on Iran & North Korea. … While the #TrumpTax is filling the pockets of Big Oil execs, Oregonians are facing some of the country’s highest gas prices. Hardworking families are forced to pinch pennies. … Americans are seeing gas prices skyrocket under the #TrumpTax. On top of that, @realDonaldTrump's decision to withdraw from the #IranNuclearDeal has American families paying even more at the pump: … NEW @SenateFinance report finds as gas prices soar for working families, the #TrumpTax is handing BILLIONS to Big Oil.  …pic.twitter.com/8qoQwWvZiU When I see the students and young people who organized the March for Our Lives in our nation’s capital, in Oregon and across the country, I see the spirit of those Thurston youngsters violently stolen from their families and loved ones. … Congress must push back against special interests that have blocked every reasonable effort to protect our children and communities from gun violence. Congress must finally honor the lives lost by passing commonsense gun laws. Today I’m remembering the shooting at Thurston High School in Springfield, 20 years ago. The horrific epidemic of gun violence in our schools rips away the lives of children and teachers, forever wounding the body and spirit of entire communities which never truly heal. That said, Dana Baiocco’s nomination is one more in a pattern. When a consumer protection job comes open, the Trump administration fills it with a corporate swamp creature who has actively opposed the protection of consumers. I’m voting NO on her nomination tonight. .@USCPSC is consumer protection 101. For example: making sure the toys toddlers put in their mouths aren’t covered in poison. Somehow the Trump administration found a way, with this nominee, to put itself on the wrong side of the poisoning children “debate.” Dana Baiocco defended a company that sold dangerous children’s toys containing lead paint. Now she’s the Trump administration’s nominee to regulate … wait for it … *THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN’S TOYS* as a @USCPSC commissioner. … Cosign. … It’s time for Congress to do some real bipartisan oversight. We need to pin down any connection between these conflicts and Trump going soft on China. Or is his foreign policy so feckless that he has to buy off China with American jobs in exchange for help with N. Korea? … A new Trump Organization project in Indonesia is waiting on a $500 million loan from the Chinese government. … The Chinese government likely pays @realDonaldTrump millions to rent offices in Trump Tower, according to Forbes. … The Bank of China owns the loan that financed a New York skyscraper the Trump Organization has a big stake in. … Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump have been asking the Chinese government for trademarks, so they can make money in the Chinese market. … When @realDonaldTrump decides to go easy on China, you have to ask who he’s working for. It’s worth remembering he has a lot of business at stake with China. Despite massive tax cuts for Big Oil companies, Americans are paying hundreds more at the pump. … Until China actually agrees to action helping American workers and there’s evidence of follow through, I’ll keep pushing for the fundamental reforms creating more high-skill, high-wage jobs for American workers. After all the tough-guy rhetoric, the Trump admin is getting rolled on trade with China. Last year, this admin thought it had a meaningful deal with China, but it delivered little more than broken promises. @realDonaldTrump, it’s not mission accomplished. Glad to partner with @MartinHeinrich, @maziehirono, @SenBooker @senrobportman & @SenAlexander to pass the bipartisan #KidstoParks Day Senate resolution to encourage kids to get outdoors & learn to lead healthy, active lives from a young age! #KidstoParks … Today is #KidstoParks Day! #FindYourPark and enjoy free events with @ORStateParks and @NatParkTrust. Here’s where to find opportunities in Oregon to #escapetheindoors:  …pic.twitter.com/uXhN4ga6Pm The fight isn't over to protect food assistance for the 1 in 8 Americans who relies on SNAP. I remain committed to protecting this essential food assistance program that millions of Americans are counting on & will do all I can to ensure it is available for those who need it. The #GOPFarmBill would have made it harder for families to access SNAP benefits by implementing burdensome paperwork requirements, while states would be left footing the bill to create new standards to evaluate SNAP participants. Good news for children & families in Oregon & across the country: the #GOPFarmBill failed today in the House. This bill threatened to take vital food assistance away from millions of Americans who are working hard just to get by. Trump seems to think Big Pharma will magically lower their prices for American consumers if other countries pay more. If Trump’s tax law is any indication, those profits are going right back to Pharma’s worldwide shareholders while U.S. families keep paying more and more.pic.twitter.com/hvSIGTWiC1 The Trump administration wants to gut funding for lifesaving health care services that millions of women rely on. Telling women what kind of care and information they can and can’t receive is Trump’s agenda of health care discrimination on full display. … I am heartbroken and angry to hear of lives lost at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. No amount of thoughts and prayers will ever be enough. We must take common-sense steps NOW to stop this senseless gun violence. If the @FCC refuses to act after this revelation then future crimes against Americans will be on the commissioners' heads. … A hacker could have used this site to know when you were in your house so they would know when to rob it.  A predator could have tracked your child’s cell phone to know when they were alone. Wireless carriers and LocationSmart appear to have allowed nearly any hacker with a basic knowledge of websites to track the location of any American with a cell phone. They value profits over privacy. This leak, only days after the lax security at Securus was exposed, shows how little companies throughout the wireless ecosystem value Americans’ security. … This bill jeopardizes SNAP benefits for millions of children through unfair work requirements that do nothing to help families. #HandsOffSNAP Tomorrow the House votes on a #FarmBill the @HouseGOP has turned into a partisan gambling chip with children standing to lose the most. … All children deserve to grow up in a safe and loving home. Now it’s time for states to take advantage of the opportunities the #FamilyFirstAct provides to improve the lives of children and families. #FosterCareMonth I’m proud Congress passed my #FamilyFirstAct with @senorrinhatch to provide real help to families in the midst of our country’s opioid epidemic. I’ll never stop working to bring America’s foster care systems up to the standards our children deserve. … May is #NationalFosterCareMonth – I’m celebrating the families and compassionate people who open their hearts and homes to #FosterYouth. #FosterCareMonth … There is much more that the full Senate and the public should know about Haspel’s background, and I am convinced that, if they did, her nomination would be rejected. In our democracy, confirmations are not supposed to take place in secret. Nominees do not get to decide what is and isn’t known about them. With Haspel’s nomination, these principles have been thrown out the window. Gina Haspel and the @CIA have conducted an unprecedented and entirely self-serving cover-up, and the U.S. Senate has been a willing partner. I’m voting NO on Haspel’s confirmation to be CIA director. .@CIA nominee Gina Haspel is exercising unprecedented power to personally censor any facts that might get in the way of her confirmation. I’m speaking out on the Senate floor against the CIA’s A – Z cover-up:  … Anyone who voted AGAINST this #NetNeutrality resolution voted FOR Big Cable and AGAINST the American public. They voted in favor of higher prices for streaming services like Netflix & Hulu, squeezing every last dollar they can out of consumers, while Big Cable cashes in. I was the first to introduce #NetNeutrality legislation in the Senate, over a decade ago, and I’m committed to fighting for telecommunications policies rooted in openness, non-discrimination, and freedom online. Voting to protect #NetNeutrality is the biggest win for the Internet since beating PIPA SOPA. I’ve spent my career fighting for a free and open internet, because I believe that EVERYONE should have fair & equal access to information. #RonReportpic.twitter.com/V7Q0SYyHIj The temporary tax breaks for craft beverage job creators will not be repealed by Democrats. Republicans are playing politics with a provision they chose to write in disappearing ink. My bill has overwhelming support in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle. It would make reductions in excise tax burdens for the beverage industry last. … The bitter truth – #TrumpTax abandoned my bipartisan bill that gave permanent tax breaks to distillers, brewers and vintners – making it more difficult for #smallbiz to make new hires and make new investments they need to thrive. The American people just scored a BIG victory in the fight to protect real #NetNeutrality and stop Big Cable. Now it’s time for the House to listen to the American people and pass this resolution to #SaveNetNeutrality. This is beyond absurd. It’s vital that Bolton and @realDonaldTrump retain a dedicated cyber advisor to ensure that our nation, critical infrastructure, and economy are protected from the ever-growing cyber-attacks on the U.S. … Since I became the first Senator to introduce net neutrality legislation more than a decade ago, I’ve fought for open, free & transparent telecommunications policies. The Senate must do the right thing to protect consumers & #smallbiz by voting to save #NetNeutrality Oregonians know what’s at stake in this fight. Ending #NetNeutrality = snail’s pace internet, rural business will have a harder time getting off the ground & rural health care providers miss out on lifesaving technological marvels. If Senate Republicans let the Trump admin to get away with ending #NetNeutrality, Americans will be charged more for their Netflix & Hulu subscriptions and music services. The Trump FCC is handing Big Cable more money and power. This Senate vote on #NetNeutrality will have the biggest direct impact on Americans’ wallets than any other vote in 2018. @realDonaldTrump and @AjitpaiFCC want to end our free and open internet.  Watch LIVE as I head to the Senate floor to share why today’s vote on #NetNeutrality is so important:  …
