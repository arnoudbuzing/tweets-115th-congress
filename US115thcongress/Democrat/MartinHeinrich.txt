Given the seriousness of these sexual assault allegations, I call on Senate Republicans to halt the proceedings until we’ve had time to fully investigate and seek the truth.  The integrity of the highest court in the land hangs in the balance. Despite multiple allegations, President Trump has refused to order the FBI to reopen Judge Kavanaugh's background check investigation and continues to demean the victims on a seemingly daily basis. Looking forward to speaking at the National Clean Energy Week Policy Makers Symposium today @PressClubDC to discuss America's clean energy future. Tune-in live @NCEWConf    #CleanEnergyWeek #NCEW18 America's most important conservation & recreation program, which has saved places in nearly every state and every county in the U.S., will expire on September 30th without action from Congress. #SaveLWCFpic.twitter.com/ii57bWSRoy It's National #CleanEnergyWeek! Array Technologies in Albuquerque is just one of New Mexico’s many innovative clean energy companies that are creating jobs and building the technologies that will power our nation’s electric grid into the future. #NCEW18 … #NationalCleanEnergyWeek fact of the day: Wind technician and solar installer are America's two fastest growing jobs!pic.twitter.com/kIqJXIEves This major investment represents a significant opportunity for @UNM to play a leading role in developing the energy technologies that will power the 21st century grid. … Pleased to welcome $2.1 million for clean air and water projects in Indian Country. In New Mexico, we know that water is life. Clean water is essential for public health, agriculture, and our way of life. … The Land and Water Conservation Fund will expire on Sunday if Congress doesn’t act. I’m doing everything I can to #SaveLWCF so it can keep protecting the parks and public lands where New Mexicans love to get outside. … One year after #HurricaneMaria, millions of Americans in #PuertoRico still struggle with reliable electricity & basic infrastructure. Read our new report on the need to upgrade & rebuild Puerto Rico’s power grid to promote economic recovery on the island:  pic.twitter.com/YJ0aUPpaF2 NEW VIDEO: Investing in #RuralAmerica is vital to the future of our country. Watch our video to see some of the opportunities for growth in rural communities & be sure to read our report on the #RuralEconomy  pic.twitter.com/OZc4Qlj5aG The outdoor recreation economy accounts for 2.2% ($412 billion) of U.S. GDP, according to updated statistics released today.  pic.twitter.com/9d45OsSG5M The sexual assault allegation made against Judge Kavanaugh deserves a thorough, professional investigation by the FBI before proceeding with any vote on his nomination to the highest court in the land. None of that can happen in a matter of just a few days. The FBI is the appropriate investigatory agency to look at this through the lens of facts, witnesses, and evidence. This is an extension of the background process, and it is common practice for them to reopen a background check after receiving new, relevant information. When a victim of sexual assault comes forward to make a harrowing allegation like this, it takes tremendous courage and needs to be taken seriously. Dr. Blasey must be treated with respect, and the matter must be investigated thoroughly by the appropriate law enforcement agency. Once again, the Trump administration is showing its true colors through a short-sighted policy decision that willfully ignores accepted science. We have a moral obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate our contributions to climate change. … The harrowing sexual assault allegations courageously made against Judge #Kavanaugh deserve a thorough, professional investigation before proceeding with any vote on his nomination to the highest court in the land. The past mistakes of the Clarence Thomas confirmation process must not be repeated. #SCOTUS … At a time when electric cars are making advances in scale of production and becoming more competitive in the marketplace, we need to continue encouraging the progress we've seen--not take our foot off the pedal. That's why I'm introducing the Electric Cars Act w/ @SenJeffMerkley. Proud to join @clairecmc and @SenatorCollins to help pass the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act to allow pharmacists to inform patients filling prescriptions of lower cost alternatives. I’m proud to cosponsor this commonsense bill to put the consumer in the driver’s seat. … We should be very careful in weighing who sits on our highest court. In light of the allegation of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh, we need to slow down and conduct the confirmation process with the seriousness required to get this right. Proud that my bipartisan legislation, the Every Kid Outdoors Act, to give 4th graders and their families free entrance to America’s public lands, passed in the House yesterday. Thanks for your leadership, @nikiinthehouse! #EveryKidOutdoors … The Trump administration’s watered down methane rules fly in the face of logic, science, and responsible decision-making. … I’m sickened by Pres. Trump’s refusal to admit the scale of loss in Puerto Rico. As our nation prepares for another hurricane, and Puerto Rican Americans are still recovering, it's disgraceful that he is more focused on rewriting history than protecting the lives of our citizens. Reduced snowpack and warmer temperatures are putting unprecedented pressures on the Rio Grande. We need to get serious about climate change. #ActOnClimate … By gutting the EPA's methane rule, the Trump administration is taking a major step backward for protecting public health, responsibly developing our natural gas resources, and meeting our responsibility to mitigate the impacts of climate change. … I’m proud to lead a bipartisan coalition from NM, CO, & KS to preserve $50 million in federal funding to maintain Amtrak service on the Southwest Chief route. @SenatorTomUdall @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner @JerryMoran @SenPatRoberts & I will keep fighting for the Southwest Chief.pic.twitter.com/9KlxeoV71r Today our nation pauses to remember those who lost their lives during the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. We will never forget them or the brave first responders who risked their lives to help their fellow Americans. This victory for conservation and outdoor traditions is something that Republicans and Democrats can agree on. This is the kind of bipartisan solution that we need more of to conserve wildlife habitat and protect hunting opportunities. As a Westerner & hunter, I'm proud to pass important sagebrush habitat restoration legislation. Restoring sagebrush landscapes to their natural state is vital for mule deer & other sage-dependent species & mitigating the risk of dangerous wildfires. … Thank you to all the New Mexicans who are engaged and making their voices heard as the Supreme Court confirmation process unfolds in the Senate. This note was just dropped off at my office in Albuquerque. I stand with you in opposing Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination! #WhatsAtStakepic.twitter.com/3Z40Jqx4rU Ranking Member @MartinHeinrich: At best, the Republican tax bill was a massive missed opportunity, squandering $1.9 trillion on tax breaks for those who don’t need them at a time our nation can least afford it. Listen live to @econ_harris as he identifies the flaws in the Republican tax bill: cuts that will increase the tax burden on working families, are poorly designed to increase investment, and do little for workers.  … If this Administration thinks treating children and families humanely is too much to ask, then DHS Secretary Nielsen should do the honorable thing and resign. They need to get real and stop looking for cruel shortcuts that tear families apart. Thank you to the @ABQCityCouncil for unanimously passing a resolution to support the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I will keep fighting to permanently reauthorize and fully fund LWCF. #SaveLWCF … Places like Rio Grande del Norte, Valles Caldera, and the Gila National Forest support New Mexico’s way of life and our nearly $10 billion outdoor recreation industry. #SaveLWCF The Land and Water Conservation Fund has been vital not only to protecting the places we love—from neighborhood parks to national monuments—but also to creating new access points and opening up previously inaccessible portions of public land. #SaveLWCF … My questions for Facebook and Twitter during the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing today about foreign influence operations and their use of social media platforms: … This is a victory for public access and the people of New Mexico. Thanks to folks like AG @HectorBalderas, and local residents like Ed Olona for making this victory possible! … I’ve seen enough. I will vote no. As long as the republicans refuse to release 96 percent of the Kavanaugh records, this process is illegitimate. Every other SCOTUS nominee has turned over nearly everything, and I am now convinced they are hiding something. We must restore “advice and consent” in the Senate before we confirm any #SCOTUS nominee that will be tainted by this partisan, broken system. Republicans are rushing to push Brett Kavanaugh’s #SCOTUS nomination through at a breakneck pace, before we can possibly review the 42,000 pages of documents on his record. #WhatAreTheyHiding I oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court on both process and substance. #SCOTUS #WhatsAtStake … We received 42,000 pages of documents JUST LAST NIGHT. It’s patently absurd to claim that we’ve had enough time to review these documents. That’s to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands of pages that are being withheld. #WhatAreTheyHiding This land needs to remain our land. Editorial via @thenewmexican @washingtonpost … If Jeff Bezos walks into a bar, the average wealth of the drinkers rises by several billion -- but nobody else gains. Why we need distributional national accounts  Shamefully similar to his tax legislation. Workers get screwed, wealthy investors reap the rewards. President Trump froze federal worker’s pay saying we couldn’t afford to compensate them for increasing costs of living, but then proposed a special tax break for investors because inflation was eating into their profits. I’m deeply saddened by the horrific loss of life in the crash between a semi-truck and a bus near Thoreau. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash. Our thoughts are with all the families affected by this tragedy. The Trump administration is questioning the citizenship of Americans who were born with midwives in border communities. Just like in South Texas, many New Mexicans are born with midwives--including both of my sons. This discrimination is un-American. … Small businesses are the backbone of our economy in New Mexico. If you're a small business owner, entrepreneur, or innovator in the state, I hope you will take a few minutes to fill out this brief survey on my website: … We need to focus on making the economy work for all New Mexicans—and all Americans—not just for those at the top. … Puerto Ricans are Americans. The scale of the devastation in Puerto Rico required so much more attention & resources than Pres. Trump was willing to provide. I will continue fighting for accountability & resources to build long-term recovery & resilience. … Our priority should be ensuring that every New Mexican – and every American – can succeed in today’s economy. Looking at headline GDP growth numbers to assess the state of our economy does not paint the whole picture, and leaves out the reality that many have not seen their wages rise for years. We need better information to finally address income inequality. … Judge Kavanaugh’s judicial opinions, his role in the Bush White House, and his stated support of the bulk collection of Americans’ phone records suggest he would give the federal government wide latitude to infringe on Americans’ individual liberties. … The United States lost one of its most steadfast heroes today. My statement on the passing of Senator John McCain:pic.twitter.com/TInndANrOd Excited to announce that Los Alamos Atomic City Transit will receive $1.485 MIL through the federal Low or No Emission Grant Program to purchase new zero-emission battery electric buses to replace the City's existing diesel fleet.

More asthma, gas guzzling cars, and ever worsening forest fires. … I'm always proud to hear stories where engaging young people in New Mexico’s great outdoors has directly inspired the next generation of conservationists. #ValleDeOro … New Mexico’s world-class scientific research is one of our state’s greatest assets. I’m proud to support these federal investments that will keep @UNM on the cutting edge of research and development for emerging energy technologies. … On top of the Facebook Data Center that I helped secure last year, this is yet another major step forward in attracting new private capital and new businesses to New Mexico. A modernized Rail Park will rival other rail-served manufacturing and distribution sites and make Valencia County an ideal place to build new manufacturing facilities. @midregioncog estimates the project could generate 3,000 new jobs. … Proud to announce a major federal investment to improve the infrastructure at the BNSF Central Rail Park in Los Lunas.pic.twitter.com/HRK4pI7PRk The world has just reached 1 Terawatt (100,000 Watts) of installed wind and solar generation capacity!

We are going to have to switch to numbers. … The Land and Water Conservation Fund has protected so many of the public lands we all treasure. New Mexicans are counting on Congress to permanently reauthorize and fully fund #LWCF before it expires on September 30. #SaveLWCF … During World War II, the Navajo Code Talkers developed an unbreakable code with the Diné language that was critical to winning the war in the Pacific. On National Code Talkers Day, and every day, I join all Americans in honoring their central role in defending our nation.pic.twitter.com/lomt74kEoA The Trump administration has shown a blatant disregard for our nation’s conservation legacy. We must protect the places that we all treasure and are integral parts of who we are as Americans. … As NM’s students & teachers head back to the classroom today and in the weeks to come, I’d like to wish all of you and your families a fun and productive school year! I will continue doing all I can to ensure our students have the education and opportunities they need to succeed.pic.twitter.com/kuMqddBtOy As one of the few people in Congress with a background in science and engineering, I have long fought for greater investments in #STEM education to put all of our students on the path to become the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs. … The Trump Administration’s proposal to restrict the Title X family planning program will make it significantly harder for women to access the health care they need. We should never allow extreme ideological views to interfere with women’s personal health care decisions. I won’t stop calling on the EPA to right this wrong, and I will keep fighting to pass long overdue hardrock mining reforms to protect the health of New Mexico’s communities, land, and water. … I’ve been proud to secure millions of dollars for long-term water quality monitoring for the entire San Juan River watershed, but we must do more to ensure communities impacted by the spill are fairly compensated. It has been three years since the Gold King Mine Spill, and the EPA still needs to address unpaid claims submitted by the recreation industry, farmers, and ranchers that suffered economic losses. Congratulations to New Mexico’s own Brian Urlacher for his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this weekend! He’s always stayed true to where he’s from. … These junk plans won’t cover prescription drugs or pre-existing conditions. Yet another way the Trump Administration is sabotaging the health care market. … Trump ideology = the freedom to ignore science, to be less competitive and to have your lunch eaten by Japanese automakers. #CleanerCars President Trump’s trade wars are threatening New Mexico’s economy. … Logging and roads don't belong in our wildest forests—period. @MartinHeinrich and @SenatorTomUdall back @SenatorCantwell bill rejecting attacks on #OurWildForests.   pic.twitter.com/tg4aNhgYI5 I’m proud to help lead effort in the Senate to save the Southwest Chief. It makes no sense for Amtrak to provide inferior service while cutting out a key part of rural America. I’m going to continue fighting any effort to undermine this important route. … I’m proud to support innovative energy research at our national labs. @SandiaLabs National Solar Thermal Test Facility’s concentrating solar power technology has great potential as it works even when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. … These tweets look a lot like an attempt to obstruct justice.  If it walks like a duck... … Solar power presents a major opportunity to create jobs all across New Mexico. I’m doing everything I can to help our tribes, local governments, schools, power providers, and rural businesses develop solar. … The head of ICE's enforcement division compared family detention centers to summer camps. Is this what you remember summer camp was like?pic.twitter.com/BuhmxyBFnt Economic development depends on 21st-century infrastructure improvements like this. The Village of Los Lunas estimates that the project will create up to 3,000 new jobs in New Mexico. … The Trump Administration still has so much to answer for in this crisis they created, but I am incredibly proud of the New Mexicans who are going above and beyond to support reunited immigrant families. … On Medicare's 53rd birthday, why are President Trump & GOP scrambling to cut $2 trillion from Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, & the ACA? Because they've given away that money in tax breaks to the wealthy. Read my op-ed w/ @ChrisVanHollen #Medicare53 … I’m fighting with a bipartisan coalition against any proposal to suspend service on Amtrak’s Southwest Chief passenger train through New Mexico. … I’m proud to lead a bipartisan group of Senators urging Amtrak to uphold its side of a longstanding public-private partnership to continue operating the Southwest Chief passenger train and long-distance passenger service that rural communities in NM and across the nation rely on.pic.twitter.com/bela07rt7A Today represents yet another missed deadline to reunite hundreds of children the Trump Admin separated from their families. We found out this week there are nearly 500 children whose parents were deported with no plan to reunite them with their children. That is unconscionable. The Senate just passed my amendment with @MartinHeinrich to support long-distance rail routes like Amtrak’s Southwest Chief. The Chief is an engine of economic growth in #NM that connects communities from Raton to Gallup--& we're fighting to keep it on track long into the future.pic.twitter.com/tOaYaE3Zlt Long-distance passenger rail routes, like the Southwest Chief, connect millions of rural Americans to the rest of the nation and serve as key economic engines. I'm fighting to ensure the vitality of this important transportation infrastructure for our nation's heartland.pic.twitter.com/1juS4G77RS When I talk with New Mexico farmers, they tell me they want trade not aid. President Trump’s trade wars are hurting our farmers, manufacturers, and consumers. I sat down today with incoming LANL Director Dr. Thom Mason. I look forward to working with him and continuing to support the incredible work of our national labs.pic.twitter.com/D3btdh0RAg It was a pleasure meeting w/ New Mexicans in the Future Farmers of America. You might not know that I grew up helping my parents run a small cattle operation. It was great to talk w/ these young leaders about provisions in the Farm Bill to continue NM's tradition in agriculture.pic.twitter.com/lmYbzFvlao All the potential we could ever ask for sits in classrooms and homes across New Mexico. But until we invest in our next generation, that promise will continue to languish. I hope this ruling leads to real action to give our schools and teachers the resources and support they need to help our children learn and thrive. It’s clear New Mexico has been on the wrong path, and there needs to be more accountability. … Pleased that the @xcelenergyNM energy loop is complete in Portales.

We must protect America’s conservation legacy so our children and future generations will be able to enjoy our national monuments and public lands. … pic.twitter.com/9Ii3C7UbWk Russia tried to meddle in our 2016 elections - they'll be back in 2018 and 2020. We must be prepared by helping states strengthen election systems. Glad to have @SenatorRounds and @SenBillNelson as new co-sponsors of our bipartisan #SecureElectionsAct today. 10 co-sponsors total. A retroactive “not” is not a defense for getting played by Vladimir Putin. Pleased that Alamogordo will receive $6.5M in infrastructure funding to complete a flood management project. With climate change driving more extreme weather, I’m committed to securing investments to improve the resiliency of NM communities. #ActOnClimate … That’s why I am fighting to pass bipartisan legislation to invest in our Park Service infrastructure to ensure our national parks, which are economic engines in rural communities across the West, are safe and accessible. The primary elevators at Carlsbad Caverns finally went into service this month for the first time since 2015. That long delay is just one example of what the National Park Service’s deferred maintenance backlog means for our parks. … In a shocking display of submissiveness, President Trump stood next to Vladimir Putin and made it clear that his allegiance is not with the American people.pic.twitter.com/rkMUYMX1kB Today’s press conference in #Helsinki was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.  My full statement on the #HelsinkiSummit:  … To my Republican colleagues, now is the time to choose country over party or forever be remembered as complicit. President Trump just turned his back on tens of thousands of hardworking American Patriots who serve in the Intelligence Community. "My people came to me...they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia. I will say this, I don't see any reason why it would be." --Trump  That's how a press conference sounds when an Asset stands next to his Handler. .@realDonaldTrump’s #TradeWar has real consequences for working Americans.

I’m calling on President Trump to reverse his decision and #KeepFamiliesTogether. … I voted to block this dangerous deal.

This is the Trump administration’s decision and they could put an end to this immoral policy today. Because they won’t, Congress must take a stand and pass our Keep Families Together Act. When you are ripping children away from their mothers all elements of government are failing basic humanity. … Bottom line from @CNN: “The Trump administration implemented the current separation policy.”   President Trump could end family separation right now.   #FamiliesBelongTogether I have no words.

Let’s be clear, women will be beaten and killed if AG Sessions succeeds at unilaterally blocking people fleeing domestic violence from seeking refugee protection in this country. This Administration is morally bankrupt. President Trump just gave a brutal North Korean dictator the international legitimacy he has always craved and got nothing in return. Weak.

Since then, presidents from both parties have used their authority under the law to protect places we all treasure in New Mexico—such as Chaco Canyon, Carlsbad Caverns, OMDP and White Sands. Even though the #EqualPayAct passed 55 years ago women still face a pay gap. This inequality is hurting families across New Mexico and I'll continue fighting for the #PaycheckFairnessAct & equal pay for equal work. RM @MartinHeinrich: HSAs are particularly helpful for those earning more than $100,000 who are already saving for retirement, and have less trouble covering their monthly bills and student loan payments.

Take advantage of our #PublicLands and find your closest park in #NM here:   @natparktrust I was proud to introduce bipartisan resolution that designates today National #KidsToParks Day. … It’s clear that there is still so much work to be done in #PuertoRico. President Trump’s administration’s decision to leave the island while Puerto Rican Americans are still recovering & preparing for hurricane season is unacceptable. … Pres Trump’s dangerous plan tacks on new restrictions to Title X, the nation’s program for affordable birth control & reproductive health care that millions of people rely on. I oppose any attempt to make it more difficult for NMs to access the health care they need. #NoGagRule President Trump's #SolarTariffs are jeopardizing tens of thousands of good-paying American jobs & hurting the economy in #NM. That doesn't sound like putting “America First” to me. @ABQBizFirst … My heart breaks for Santa Fe, Texas. We need to wake up from this nightmare & stop accepting these horrific shooting as the status quo. Action to end gun violence now! Judicial nominees refusing to say that #BrownVBoard was decided correctly is completely disqualifying. Period. I'm concerned that Trump Admin continues to appoint people #UnfitToJudge that when approved spend the rest of their lives on the Federal Bench. Proud to lead a bipartisan group of Senators with @SenRobPortman urging Trump Admin to take additional steps to combat Anti-Semitism, appoint Special Envoy.  pic.twitter.com/e2owW3jD0a If you need further proof that President Trump still isn’t taking #CyberSecurity & threats from Russia’s online army seriously: … .@realDonaldTrump, would you speak that way about your ancestors? Let me tell you something: When you attack immigrants, you're attacking me. You're attacking my grandfather who crossed the Rio Grande to pursue the American Dream. RT to tell Pres. Trump you stand with immigrants! … I’m voting NO on Gina Haspel today. Her failure to take personal responsibility for any role she might have played in CIA’s torture program & her conflicting replies to questions about the destruction of videotapes related to the program make her unsuitable to lead the CIA. The vote to confirm Gina Haspel is today, yet Senators are still being blocked from seeing a key piece of her story & history with CIA torture program and destruction of tapes. We must #UnlockDurhamReport so Senators know the truth before they cast their vote. The Justice Department must #UnlockDurhamReport before Gina Haspel's nomination faces a floor vote in the Senate.pic.twitter.com/S3Ib7KDjLF My bipartisan #StopAct bill would prohibit the exporting of sacred Native American items and increase penalties for stealing and illegally trafficking tribal cultural patrimony.

Now onto the full Senate! … CONFIRMED: After a thorough review, Senate Intel has found no evidence to dispute the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia, on orders from Putin, carried out an unprecedented election interference effort to help the Trump campaign and hurt the Clinton campaign in 2016. … There is no good reason for the lack of response to #PuertoRico, and now new hurricanes on the horizon pose even greater threats. No American should ever be left in danger like this. … We just voted to restore #NetNeutrality & we won! Thank you to everyone who spoke out to #SaveTheInternet, we won’t stop fighting because access to a free and open internet effects everyone.pic.twitter.com/LSf5gjw9Tb It’s time to right the Trump Administration’s wrong: Americans need #NetNeutrality, because access to the open internet fosters the creativity and innovation that is at the heart of our economy. There’s a real sense of urgency around #NetNeutrality, because Americans see this for what it is: a giveaway to big companies that takes money right out of your pockets. #SaveTheInternet We can’t let President Trump’s @FCC destroy the internet. I’m voting to #SaveTheInternet because without #NetNeutrality this is what the internet would look like.pic.twitter.com/G9h0IyG3JX How would you explain the repeal of Net Neutrality?

Imposing these caps would force states to choose between covering fewer people & cutting services or raising taxes.  pic.twitter.com/SwDacUnh4c On this week's #MeatEaterPodcast, @stevenrinella talks with Senator @MartinHeinrich about thinking long-term; the Sabinoso Wilderness as a big win for hunters; why the Land and Water Conservation Fund is always imperiled, and why it shouldn’t be; and more.  pic.twitter.com/Cv1lQu4stB Since the @FCC voted to remove #NetNeutrality rules, New Mexicans have been making their voices heard. The message is loud and clear: they don’t want their right to a free and open internet blocked. In my view Gina Haspel’s failure to take personal responsibility for any role she might have played in the CIA’s detention & interrogation program & her conflicting replies to questions about the destruction of videotapes related to the program make her unsuitable to lead the CIA Today I voted against Gina Haspel to be Director of the CIA. … I’m voting to #SaveTheInternet in the Senate today.

The Trump Administration’s move to deliberately rip apart families has no place in our country. … The Trump Admin still hasn’t provided a response to this letter sent in March by 14 senators on the status of a cyber deterrence strategy either. Instead, Bolton wants to essentially get rid of the Cyber lead for the federal government?pic.twitter.com/0vA0KErc0U National Security Advisor Bolton should be protecting us from threats, not opening us up to new ones. Cutting a key cyber role is the opposite of what we need & shows that the Trump Admin still isn't taking the threat from Russia's online army seriously. … Take a look at this incredible report about Medicaid by the Senate Joint Economic Committee. This vital program is woven into the fabric of American life.  … @MartinHeinrich These attacks by Fox news ring hollow – the fact is that #Solar is working in communities across the nation. … Republicans promised their #GOPTaxScam would benefit American workers, but the average hourly wage for production & nonsupervisory workers only rose by 0.1% from the prior year after adjusting for inflation. … This backward, antiquated thinking has no place in America, let alone the Oval Office. John Kelly and this Admin need a reality check. Clearly they haven't met NM’s teacher of the year. … Designating White Sands as #WhiteSandsNP will ensure that 1 of NM’s greatest treasures receives protection & recognition it deserves so it can continue to bolster the local economy. @ABQJournal Editorial: NM’s White Sands worthy of national park status … Students across Indian Country deserve high-quality education in a safe environment where they can learn and thrive.

I’m not convinced of her moral judgment. … I was looking for “the buck stops here” from her when it came to answering my questions about torture – instead I got legalistic answers to very basic moral questions. … The nomination of Gina Haspel to head the CIA isn’t happening in a vacuum, it’s happening while people like President Trump & former VP Dick Cheney are calling for torture to be brought back. … I believe Gina Haspel is a patriot who loves our country & has devoted her professional life to its service & defense. However, her role in overseeing the use of torture is disturbing & her refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying.  … It’s clear that we need a cyber doctrine to protect our country and deter #CyberAttacks. Additionally, we should pass my bipartisan bill with @SenAngusKing & @SenatorRisch to protect America’s energy infrastructure from potentially catastrophic cyber-attacks. … This morning @SenJohnHoeven and I had a frank discussion about what needs to be done to protect/modernize our #EnergyGrid and how to work across the aisle to advance our nation’s energy priorities.

It was a pleasure to meet with Aztec Police Department Chief Mike Heal in Farmington last week.

The fact is, there are scores of well-qualified women. I think it’s insulting to women that Haspel is the considered the only one qualified for that job. #AMR Apparently POTUS equates torture with being tough. I think our men and women in uniform are plenty tough as it is. Torture is weak. … We’re calling on the CIA to declassify information on Gina Haspel’s role in the Enhanced Interrogation Program. Without making this information available to the American people, her nomination cannot be fully and properly considered by the Senate. … This made me sick to my stomach.
