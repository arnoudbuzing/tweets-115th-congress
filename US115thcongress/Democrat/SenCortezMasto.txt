On 10/1, United Blood Services & @UMCSN are teaming up to host the largest blood drive in NV's history in honor of the #1October victims, survivors, & first responders. I'm calling on all Nevadans who are able to give to please consider donating.  WATCH to learn how you can give:pic.twitter.com/9nlbSrqhzR NV's #Medicaid expansion has helped thousands in our rural communities no longer go without health care. Before Medicaid expansion, low-income residents in NV's rurals had an uninsured rate of 42% - & now it's dropped to 14%. It's clear: the #ACA is working & it must be protected … The Senate GOP should really be looking themselves in the mirror asking what kind of country they want their children & grandchildren living in. And what kind of message they'll be sending to them in what we value as a nation should they choose to move forward with a vote Friday. This shouldn't be about winning or left versus right politics. This is about the future of the Supreme Court & the decisions it will make that could last generations. This is about whether we're confirming #JudgeKavanaugh to a lifetime appointment on the highest court in the land, our most revered institution. This is about determining whether he's fit to sit on the #SCOTUS - & part of that is a thorough examination of his character. With 3 women who've courageously come forward to share their stories, it's past time the Senate GOP bring #JudgeKavanaugh's confirmation process to a halt. Brett Kavanaugh's FBI background investigation must be reopened. We must have all of the facts before @senjudiciary votes. "This is also a teaching moment in how we handle this matter as adults, because we are in a moment right now where we are trying to change the culture of violence against women," @SenCortezMasto says.  … via @LasVegasSun Grateful @HHSGov has awarded a total of nearly $400,000 to the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony & Washoe Tribe of Nevada & California to help combat the #opioidcrisis. I'll continue fighting for crucial funding for those struggling with substance abuse issues in our tribal communities. It was an honor to meet Nevada's 2018 Principal of the Year, Jamey Hood, of @garrettbobcats today! Principal Hood has been teaching at Garrett Junior High for 14 years & her school is recognized as one of ten, five-star schools in @ClarkCountySch. Thank you for everything you do.pic.twitter.com/Yi2eeJjeOq On June 17, @SecNielsen tweeted "We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period." Well, according to new information, it's clear @DHSgov's intent from the start was to rip families apart as a deterrent to crossing our southern border … In an interview with @wolfblitzer of @CNN, he asked me whether I thought the @senjudiciary should invite Deborah Ramirez to testify on her allegation against #JudgeKavanaugh.   WATCH to hear my response on that -->pic.twitter.com/Hz6aMlFc4N I disagree with @SenateGOP's decision to have an outside female counsel question Dr. Ford. This is not a criminal trial. We're determining whether #JudgeKavanaugh's fit to sit on #SCOTUS, in a lifetime appointment. That's why the FBI needs to reopen the background investigation.pic.twitter.com/Zna1xVVU4T I've reviewed #JudgeKavanaugh's court rulings, some of his writings, & watched his confirmation hearing. It's clear - his judicial philosophy is extreme. My fight has always been about protecting women’s reproductive freedoms & I have serious concerns he will roll back #RoeVWade.pic.twitter.com/c1qQ28DqJu The allegations against #JudgeKavanaugh are very serious. That’s why my colleagues & I have been clear: We need to reopen the FBI's background investigation. Only then, once we have that information before us, can we have a fair & open hearing. WATCH my interview w/ @wolfblitzerpic.twitter.com/XwfMb6Eebc October 1, 2018, marks a year since the #1October massacre in Las Vegas. So many people have scars from that night, visible & invisible. I'm grateful the Senate unanimously passed a resolution last night to honor the memory & heroism of all those involved that night #VegasStrongpic.twitter.com/nlGm9kCGan "This is not a time for us to give up. This is the time for us to keep pushing and contacting your senators. It matters when we see that activity in Washington and across the country" - @SenCortezMasto. #BelieveSurvivors .@SenCortezMasto uses health care as a great example of how regular Nevadans made calls and wrote letters to fight back against the repeal effort. #SCOTUS is no different. Our voices matter and can stop Kavanaugh from turning back the clock on women's rights #StopKavanaugh "I will tell you on this particular issue it's 4-1 against Kavanaugh, so it does matter to my colleagues when they hear from their constituents on this issue. When you contact and call your senators, it matters" - @SenCortezMasto. #BelieveSurvivors "I can't stress it enough that it's a life-time appointment. That's why I take this very, very seriously and I think we should all have the opportunity to have all the information before we cast our votes" - @SenCortezMasto. .@SenCortezMasto comes out strong on demanding a full investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. Questions of character are important and require due consideration. Thank you for standing with survivors, Senator! #BelieveSurvivors #StopKavanaugh "There is no doubt in my mind that [Kavanaugh] is not someone who should sit on our highest court for a lifetime appointment" @SenCortezMasto says of Kavanaugh's record on reproductive choice #StopKavanaugh "After reviewing the records we had access to, and watching his answers in committee, there is no doubt in my mind that he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court" - @SenCortezMasto. Tonight at 5:30pm PT, I'll be joining @NV_Advocates on why I'll be voting NO on #JudgeKavanaugh. We must continue to fight to protect #RoeVWade, stand up for #PlannedParenthood, & fight for women's health care! If you have a question, I want to hear from you. Call: (702) 820-4864 Have questions about how Kavanaugh’s nomination could impact Nevadans? Join @SenCortezMasto and @NV_Advocates for a Tele-town Hall tonight at 5:30 p.m. Call-in number is: (702) 820-4864. Join @SenCortezMasto for a Tele-town Hall at 5:30 p.m. where she’ll speak to Nevadans about the potential impacts of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination. #StopKavanaugh This is the final week for #1October survivors to sign up for the Nevada Victims of Crime Fund.

Thank you Senator for fearlessly breaking down barriers & inspiring Latinas everywhere to do the same. #HispanicHeritageMonthpic.twitter.com/lCbHaKewAV In June, I hosted a roundtable in Reno to discuss my commitment to advocating for Alzheimer's patients and caretakers. My BOLD Act w/ @SenatorCollins would promote groundbreaking Alzheimer’s research & treatment options. … Joined @ChrisVanHollen in a letter opposing @realDonaldTrump’s inhumane decision to withdraw more than $500 million in aid to the Palestinian people. The funding has provided water, food, education, & medical relief to families in the West Bank & Gaza.   … How are you spending #NationalPublicLandsDay? Tell me about your visits to national parks or your volunteer work. Public lands are a part of our nation’s rich history.

Enjoy free entrance to all national parks today.pic.twitter.com/OHmRi1fjHc Nevadans continue to see the consequences of climate change firsthand as our summers get hotter and our fire season grows longer and drier. It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to take climate change seriously. … As our fire seasons grow hotter and drier, all Nevadans must come together and be vigilant in ensuring that we are doing all we can to prevent wildfires. Please remember to only target shoot in areas designated as a shooting range. … As @fema continues to refuse assistance to help offset costs of the Sugarloaf Fire, I'm making sure our rural communities aren’t overlooked. I stand w/ NV’s Forester/Firewarden in calling on FEMA to reconsider denying our community the funding it needs. … On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we reflect on the sacrifices and service of those who are or have been prisoners of war, and those who are still missing in action. … Perhaps Mr. Cohn should look in the mirror and see who exactly is culpable for the financial collapse that ruined the lives of countless Nevadans. Spoiler: it isn’t the waitress from Las Vegas. Las Vegans earn an honest living in pursuit of the American dream. And before Dodd-Frank, banks and executives like Gary Cohn were misleading consumers and borrowers to take on more than what they can to profit from them. In the interview, Cohn said, “Who broke the law? I just want to know who you think broke the law. Was the waitress in Las Vegas who had six houses leveraged at 100 percent with no income, was she reckless and stupid? Or was the banker reckless and stupid?” Thread: In an interview with Reuters, Gary Cohn suggested that borrowers were just as responsible for the financial crisis that decimated Las Vegas 10 years ago. … Estamos con Puerto Rico.

El mes pasado me uní a @SenWarren en exigir respuestas sobre cómo estos nuevos números afectarán los fondos y asistencia para ciudadanos estadounidenses.   … .@fema & @HHSGov have been silent about the true death toll in #PuertoRico. Last month, I joined @Senwarren in demanding answers about how the new numbers will impact funding and assistance for U.S. citizens on the island.  … #JudgeKavanaugh would be the deciding vote to overturn a woman's right to choose. How do I know this? Because @realDonaldTrump said he would nominate judges to the Supreme Court that would overturn #RoevWade.

Now more than ever, we need to make investments that will help rebuild, recover & reduce #PuertoRico's vulnerability to natural disasters in the future. A un año del #HuracánMaría, muchos en #PuertoRico aún están batallando para obtener suministros y servicios básicos como servicio eléctrico estable y agua potable. Queda claro que la respuesta federal no fue un “éxito no reconocido” … One year after #HurricaneMaria, many in #PuertoRico are still struggling with basic necessities – like reliable electricity & safe drinking water. It's clear the federal response on the island was not an "unsung success". … Tres mil ciudadanos estadounidenses perdieron la vida tras el #HuracánMaría. El congreso debe hacer que la administración rinda cuentas por su negligencia, exigir que se haga lo correcto para #PuertoRico y asegurar que la isla tenga el apoyo que necesita. Three thousand U.S. citizens lost their lives in the aftermath of #HurricaneMaria. Congress must hold this Administration accountable for its negligence, demand we do right by #PuertoRico & ensure the island has the support it needs. Coming home after a job well done!

I'll have more on @8NewsNow tonight at 6. Kathy Kraninger was one of the top people that played a key role implementing @realDonaldTrump's family separation policy & also oversaw the failed gov't response to #HurricaneMaria. Now I want to know why she transferred $9.8 million from @fema to @ICEgov  … For more on why I'll be voting NO on #JudgeKavanaugh, be sure to tune in to @8NewsNow for my interview with @SteveSebelius at 6pm PT. While I unfortunately didn't get a chance to sit down & discuss my concerns with #JudgeKavanaugh, it's clear that Brett Kavanaugh is a threat to women's rights. I look forward to voting NO on this nominee because nothing less than a woman's right to choose is on the line. … From his challenge of #RoeVWade as "settled law’" to his far-fetched dissent denying a 17-year-old undocumented immigrant in detention from accessing an abortion, I have no doubt that #JudgeKavanaugh's confirmation would tip the balance of the Supreme Court to end Roe v. Wade. After carefully reviewing #JudgeKavanaugh's record & listening to his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have determined that his stance on a woman’s right to choose is extreme & disqualifies him from a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. My first episode of Broadband Conversations is live! @SenCortezMasto and I talk about how to get more girls in STEM, smarter cities, and what the future of connectivity means for all of us.

Nevada is the #InnovationState & I'll continue to support, strengthen, & promote our leadership in technology. … 350,000 deportation cases are closed because judges made determinations in the best interests of the kids. Yet, DHS & DOJ want to re-open each. This is yet another attack on undocumented immigrants. I wrote to @SecNielsen & AG Sessions demanding answers. … Since assuming control of the @CFPB, @MickMulvaneyOMB has been sabotaging the agency & putting consumers at risk. I joined @SenSherrodBrown & my colleagues demanding answers regarding concerns raised after the resignation of @CFPB's student loan watchdog … Grateful to our Airmen & women for everything they do to protect our freedoms & defend our country.

Thank you to all that are serving - past & present. #AFBDaypic.twitter.com/HjnkfQwUM0 On #ConstitutionDay, let us never forget the phrase “We the People”. This phrase is the heart of our great nation. As we continue to ensure individual rights & freedoms are protected by the law; we must also fight for those who are on the path to citizenship. The new affordable apartments in south Reno are a small-scale example of the importance of collaboration, but it will only make a dent in @washoecounty's overwhelming need for affordable housing.

The allegation she's made against #JudgeKavanaugh must be taken seriously - & must be investigated by the FBI & the Senate. @senjudiciary must delay Thursday's vote. And we must give Dr. Ford the opportunity to testify. This #HispanicHeritageMonth takes a somber tone b/c of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in #PuertoRico & at our southern border. Let us not simply pay lip service to our Hispanic communities, but recommit ourselves to equality for Puerto Ricans & providing refuge for those in need 10 years ago today, Lehman Brothers collapsed & set off the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

Come out & take advantage of free health screenings, flu shots, & help with Medicare & VA benefits.pic.twitter.com/DSB8UTDWuG I stand with @JudiciaryDems in calling on Chairman Grassley to suspend #JudgeKavanaugh's hearing until the Senate can do its job & have ample time to review the 42k documents dropped on us last night. But right now - this isn't "regular order" - this is a joke. #WhatAreTheyHiding … Reminder: The Senate still has yet to see most of Judge Kavanaugh’s record, & just last night Republicans released 42,000 pages of WH documents. The American people deserve more time to review Kavanaugh's record & decisions he made regarding women’s health, health care, & more. .@SenFeinstein is absolutely right. This is beyond absurd. The Senate should be given the time it needs to review these documents & exercise our Constitutional responsibility. The American people deserve transparency. And the Senate should be able to do its job #WhatAreTheyHiding … Today, the confirmation hearings for #JudgeKavanaugh began, despite the Senate not having every necessary document needed for review. Not to mention, documents the American people should have access to. This process is a complete sham & this hearing should be halted immediately. … Glad some of my staff were able to enjoy Virginia City’s #LaborDay Parade today! This town sure does know how to throw a great celebration.pic.twitter.com/f3usMZKm1o Today, our fight continues to make our workplaces more equitable: to end workplace discrimination, increase wages, ensure equal pay for equal work, & for NV's unions to remain strong. On #LaborDay, we honor the contributions of American workers who have fought for this all & more We cannot ignore the science of climate change and we should not trust those who tell us we must prioritize a few polluters over our health, our air and our clean energy jobs of the future. … In recognition of International Overdose Awareness Day, we must recommit ourselves to providing more resources for mental health care services and fighting against the opioid epidemic that is killing an unprecedented number of Americans. … I'm glad the Court recognized that halting DACA wouldn't serve the best interests of the country. Congress must work together in a bipartisan way to give DREAMers the security of knowing they may continue to live in the only country they’ve ever known. As I worked with community partners on affordable housing, one thing is clear: prices are skyrocketing & too many can’t afford to live in communities they serve. Proud to have fought for $8 million to invest in housing & community development programs.  … If we wish to leave a safer, cleaner world for our children and grandchildren, we need to listen to those who have dedicated their lives to the science behind preserving our planet. My @lasvegassun op-ed on why we cannot afford to ignore climate science: … Workers have the right for their voices to be heard at the negotiating table. Companies must respect their workers’ right to union representation. … The transformation of Virginia St will better serve the needs of local residents, students & tourists! Nevada’s growth as an #InnovationState is thanks in part to public & private partnerships.

And a big shoutout to Councilman McKenzie for always ensuring that our first responders get the support they need. … Calling on @BetsyDeVosED to prioritize students over predatory for-profit colleges.

Grateful for @ACTIONN_NV and others in Nevada, and across the country working to solve our nation’s dire affordable housing crisis. Everyone deserves a safe home they can afford. Thanks to broadband access & technology, telemedicine has brought much needed health care to geographically isolated communities. @FCC’s pilot program will connect rural communities to health services, especially pregnant women, mothers & babies who are in need of maternal care. … It's unacceptable that @fema has refused to grant additional assistance to help the state fight the Sugarloaf Fire with great urgency. Wildlife habitat and the livelihood of Nevada's ranchers are at stake. … Instead of making health care more affordable, junk plans raise premiums for other consumers and deny protections to patients with pre-existing conditions. Proud to join @SenatorBaldwin in her fight for access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans. … Thank you for more than 100 years of service to our country! … Our libraries and schools rely on a fair and open internet to educate students and train workers. The repeal of #NetNeutrality threatens access to education by giving those who can afford to pay more the ability to set their own rules. … Too many children in our state are born without the resources they need to learn, grow, and prepare for school. That's why I'm proud to announce more than $1 million in grant funding from the HHS to benefit vulnerable kids and families in Nevada.  … The Land and Water Conservation Fund provides resources that promote wildlife conservation in Nevada and spur our outdoor recreation economy. I'll work to make sure that our state continues to receive this critical support and funding. … The Clean Power Plan was implemented to protect the air we breathe & slow down the acceleration of climate change. And yet, the Trump administration is frivolously rolling back these protections.   The cost? Up to 1,400 more premature deaths a year. … On this day in 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. called on Congress to end institutionalized discrimination. We should all take a few moments today to read his words, honor his legacy, and re-dedicate ourselves to the fight to make his dream a reality.  …pic.twitter.com/YGRasggKRv Partnered with @senrobportman on a bill to better address the unique challenges and needs of rural communities. Our legislation will encourage economic growth and use of innovative technologies. … It’s been almost a year since Hurricane Maria and we are still finding out what really happened in Puerto Rico. Congress cannot turn a blind eye to this atrocity. We must learn the truth and provide more help and support to our fellow Americans. … Please read my father's farewell letter to the country he loved so much - “Do not despair of our present difficulties but believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender.” pic.twitter.com/pwZUR7R3dp Half of rural counties lack a hospital with a maternity ward.

I will continue working in the Senate to ensure that survivors of domestic violence get the support, treatment, and resources they need to begin healing. … Sen. McCain was an American hero, a true statesman & gentleman in every possible sense. This is an enormous loss for the Senate, for Arizona, and for the nation. Paul and I extend our profound condolences to the McCain family. We wish them comfort, solace, and peace at this time. Nearly 700 personnel are on the scene working to protect structures & the community from the South Sugarloaf Fire. Thank you to all of the brave & dedicated firefighters working around the clock to keep us safe. … NV’s proud to be home to thousands of immigrants who make our country stronger. I hope @Culinary226’s free workshop today will encourage immigrants to pursue the opportunities available to them to become naturalized U.S. citizens & embrace their role as leaders in our community.pic.twitter.com/CknxbPCVNf There needs to be greater transparency and accountability in lobbying.

This will provide certainty to critical agencies in Vegas that respond to catastrophic events like 1October & prevent future tragedies. I'm proud to work with Nellis AFB to improve the quality of their privatized military housing complexes. My recent legislation, included in the NDAA, will further support the work being done to ensure military housing in Nevada continues to meet quality standards.pic.twitter.com/VMWwsx2QOs Throughout his battle against brain cancer, @SenJohnMcCain has inspired us all with his dignity and grace in the face of hardship.

We urge every Senator to support it. Its passage should be an urgent priority for every member of Congress.  What the Trump admin has done by separating families at our border flies in the face of who we are & what we value as Americans: children & families. This week I introduced the #REUNITEAct with @SenKamalaHarris @SenJeffMerkley to hold the admin accountable … The primary duty of our Commander in Chief is to protect our national security. @realDonaldTrump continually fails to acknowledge the threat Russia poses to our elections - as our intel has found. His blind support for Putin should make us all question where his loyalties lie. Congratulations in advance to these inspiring & brave folks on being awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at tonight's @espn ESPYS! … Yesterday, @SenJeffMerkley, @SenCortezMasto and I joined together to introduce the REUNITE Act – a bill that immediately reunites children and parents who were separated at the border, and establishes a permanent system to protect and reunify separated families.pic.twitter.com/U927GSFs35 If #YuccaMountain were to reopen, the primary mode of transpo of this nuclear waste will travel by train throughout the country.

But because of @realDonaldTrump's heinous border policy, over 2,500 children remain separated from their parents. My, @SenKamalaHarris, & @SenJeffMerkley's #REUNITEAct will reunify these families now. … I told those parents that I would bring their stories back to DC & that people in this country are fighting for them – that’s what the #REUNITEAct is about. We do not stop fighting. This is about who we are as Americans & what we’re projecting to the world #FamiliesBelongTogetherpic.twitter.com/qJbyHW23Qk This admin sorted these families like they were cattle. It was disgusting & inhumane. And whether you’re a parent or not – we all know this is not who we are as a country. This admin never had the intention of reuniting these families. Never ever. There was no plan. #REUNITEActpic.twitter.com/2CkOEdEgU6 When I went to our southern border three weeks ago, I talked with six mothers & four fathers at an @ICEgov facility – each one asked me the same thing: they asked me "where their child is, what was going on in the outside world, & how long were they going to be locked up for?"pic.twitter.com/2tapkbl4cf As Americans, we value our kids. As Americans, we do no harm to kids. We do no harm. It’s outrageous what this admin has done. Separating families at the border is a crisis manufactured by this admin.

But part of that means #YuccaMountain remains nothing but a hole in the ground. Nevadans have been clear: they will fight like hell against a nuclear waste dump in their backyard. … NV was ground zero for the housing crisis. Our unemployment rate was at 15% at one time.

Thank you @SenCortezMasto @SenKamalaHarris & @SenJeffMerkley for introducing this bill today ensuring critical protections for separated children & families #FamiliesBelongTogether … Thank you @SenCortezMasto for your continued dedication to ensure these children and families who have been needlessly separated at the US border are reunited and have the legal protections they deserve #FamiliesBelongTogether #REUNITEAct … President Trump should work with Democrats to solve the refugee crisis in Central America & stop treating innocent children as political pawns. We must continue to fight like hell for these families every single day & keep raising our voices until every family is reunited. Passing the #REUNITEAct would put an end to the human rights crisis at our southern border, & I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting it. But let me be clear: Congress did not create this crisis. This crisis falls solely on @realDonaldTrump's shoulders. The #REUNITEAct would 1) prohibit the admin from detaining children indefinitely; 2) prevent the admin from deporting parents before their children's immigration proceeding; & 3) direct the AG, DHS & HHS Secs to establish an "Office for Locating & Reuniting Children w/ Parents" All the women I spoke w/ experienced the same thing. They all faced horrific gang violence & abuse in their home country. They fled to save their lives. That's why @SenKamalaHarris @SenJeffMerkley & myself have introduced the #REUNITEAct, requiring immediate reunification. The parents I spoke to had no information. They were asking me if I knew where their kids were. I told them that I didn’t, & that I was asking those same questions. I promised the parents that I would take their stories back with me to D.C. to do something to help. The Trump admin gave no thought to the damage inflicted on these families & these children. They ripped these kids out of their parents’ arms with no plan to reunite them. They never planned to. And now the trauma they've experienced will be with them for a lifetime. These women came to this country seeking freedom & protection for themselves & their children. But instead, they were arrested & thrown in a jail cell. Their children were put on buses & driven away. #FamiliesBelongTogether I sat down one mother named Ana. After her & her 5 yo daughter witnessed a brutal murder, they fled their home country to keep them safe. When they got here, they were torn apart. They locked her up & took her daughter. These stories should outrage anyone. Three weeks ago, I traveled to our southern border. I wanted to see for myself how these children were being treated. I was locked out! They wouldn't even let me in. And then I went to an ICE detention facility - it was no different than a prison I've seen in NV. Today, I'm joining @SenKamalaHarris @SenJeffMerkley to send a clear message to the Trump admin: ripping away kids from their parents at the border & holding them behind bars indefinitely is unacceptable. It is inhumane. And it is not who we are as Americans #FamiliesBelongTogther In one hour, @SenJeffMerkley, @SenCortezMasto & I will be making an important announcement on the fight to reunify families. Watch live here:  .@realDonaldTrump's family separation policy is cruel, ineffective, & inhumane. Instead of picking fights with our closest allies or defending a dictator, he should spend his time focused on reuniting the thousands of families his admin tore apart. #FamilesBelongTogether A trio of conservationists welcoming folks to the Latino Conservation Week Kick-Off Party in Las Vegas!

They never intended to. @realDonaldTrump, it's past time you finally do your job - & provide us with a concrete plan in how you'll reunite these familiespic.twitter.com/DXr9UyFuRt This admin has suggested that the reunification process is so slow b/c too many Members of Congress are taking tours of these facilities. I couldn't help but laugh when I heard that. I tried, they locked me out! I wasn't allowed in to check on the conditions of these children.pic.twitter.com/Yrxb3CFQJx @SecAzar testified recently that there's "no reason why any parent would not know where their children is located."

Don’t treat innocent children & their parents as political pawns. Don’t turn your back on everything this country stands for. #FamiliesBelongTogether Locking-up families who are seeking asylum under laws we have put in place will be a moral stain on our country for generations. @realDonaldTrump, the American people demand that you explain how you plan to reunite these families that you’ve scarred forever & ripped apart. We do not tear babies out of their mother’s arms. We’ve always had a guiding principle when it comes to children. We do no harm. Whether they’re Honduran children, or Guatemalan children, or Salvadoran children, or American children. We do no harm. #FamiliesBelongTogether The physiological trauma they’ve inflicted on these children will last a lifetime. I’m calling on President Trump to finally do his job & provide us with a concrete plan. I want to see results. I won’t stop fighting until every child has been reunited with their parents! The Trump admin can’t pin the blame for this on Congress, Democrats, or anyone else. They’re missing their deadlines for one reason & one reason only: because they never made a plan to reunite these families. They never intended to. Two weeks later - they still have no plan. The Trump admin's suggested that the reunification process is slow because too many Members of Congress are taking tours of these detention facilities. I couldn't help but laugh when I heard that. I tried to enter a children's detention facility & they locked me out! In the midst of this, @HHSGov discovered that they've been holding a toddler who may be a U.S. citizen in detention for over a year. How could this be possible? How could the reunification process be so erratic, inefficient, & slow? This admin's been making excuses left & right. Three different entities in the Trump admin's working to reunify families. But none of them are working together! Now, the admin has missed its court-ordered deadline to reunite children under five. And as far as we know, out of 102 children, only four of them have been reunited. Secretary Azar testified recently that there is “no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located.” Not true. I spoke with 10 mothers & fathers who had no clue where their kids were. They had tears running down their faces as they pleaded with me to help them. Because of @realDonaldTrump's inhumane family separation policy, we have over 3,000 children separated from their parents. Their moms & dads just want to have their children back in their arms. All six of the women I talked to at the detention facility fled to the U.S. expecting to find freedom & protection. Instead, they were thrown in jail & their children were loaded on buses & taken away. Now, these mothers desperately want to know where their children are. I asked the group of women why they can't go to the police. They explained that the police are just as corrupt as the gangs. In their countries, there's no rule of law. If you want to save your children's lives, your only option is to flee. And that's what these women did. Each one of them I spoke with had kids 12 & under who were taken from them. Their stories were the same; they had all faced horrific gang violence & abuse in their home country - & fled to protect their family. They had been raped & tortured. They watched loved ones get murdered Ana traveled 3,000 miles to get to our Southern border. When she finally arrived, she thought, “Oh my god, I’m finally safe. I’m going to tell them who I am and why I’m here.” When she did, she was arrested & her daughter was put on a bus & driven hundreds of miles away. I went to an ICE detention facility & sat down with six mothers whose children had been separated from them. One of them was Ana, who has a 5-year-old daughter. After witnessing a brutal murder in her neighborhood, she decided to leave the country in order to keep them safe. Over two weeks ago, I traveled to McAllen & Brownsville, Texas, to see @realDonaldTrump's heinous border policy for myself. What I saw, & the stories I heard from parents who were separated from their children, will be with me forever. #FamiliesBelongTogether HAPPENING SOON: I'll be speaking on the #Senate floor sharing the stories I heard from my southern border trip around @realDonaldTrump's heinous border policy of family separation. #FamiliesBelongTogether   WATCH LIVE -->  … Hurricane Maria left Puerto Rico completely devastated. Now, @realDonaldTrump's pick to lead the Consumer Bureau, Kathy Kraninger, was tasked with carrying out the admin's agenda there. @SenatorMenendez & I want a full accounting of the role she played. … The Trump admin is no longer defending the Affordable Care Act’s protections for pre-existing conditions. We will not go back to the days when people would be charged obscene amounts - or denied coverage altogether - for having health issues. That's #WhatsAtStake with #ScotusPickpic.twitter.com/VtsbJpz7gc We need a #SCOTUS Justice who will protect our care, We need a Justice who will not roll back women's rights by over 40 years. We need a Justice who will not put the government between a woman & her doctor. We need a Justice who will not rip away our right to choose #WhatsAtStakepic.twitter.com/89l2nEXEFM Three years ago today #BasinAndRange was established as a national monument. Last August, I had the pleasure of visiting it with my State Director. What a stunning place! It's part of NV's cultural history & boosts our rural economies. We must continue fighting to protect it.pic.twitter.com/7Yv0AeVBUO These stats are not just numbers. They are human beings. They are small children who have been left terrified, traumatized, & broken because of @realDonaldTrump's barbaric border policy. This admin needs to work harder to reunite these families now. … Right-wing special interests are working to drown out the voices of all Americans by funding secret money campaigns attacking the rights of teachers & public employees. #SCOTUS has sided with them in #JanusvsAFSCME. Today, I join them to fight back! LIVE:   … .@realDonaldTrump has stated clearly that he believes #RoevWade could be changed. That's #WhatsAtStake here with #ScotusPick: a woman's right to choose. If you care about this issue - or are a woman - this could effect you. Now, it's more important than ever to raise your voice!pic.twitter.com/qYTylzuZAv The list of #WhatsAtStake with Pres. Trump's #ScotusPick could go on. But, I want to be clear about two of them: a woman's right to choose & our access to quality, affordable healthcare. If you care about either of these issues - I urge you to get involved, speak out, & fight! Again, this president showing what a complete lack of respect he has for the rule of law. Outrageous. But here's the bottom line & what's most important here: this admin needs to reunify families at our southern border immediately. And we need to keep raising hell until they do! … Incredible news. Grateful to hear they're all safe - & what a job well done by the Thai Navy SEALs. The United States was with you all the way. … We need a #SCOTUS Justice who respects the rights & freedoms enshrined in our Constitution, not someone who is beholden to special interest groups. I plan to meet with Judge Kavanaugh in the coming months & will review his qualifications thoroughly. President Trump’s #ScotusPick will hold immense power over the most critical issues facing our nation, including a woman’s right to choose, protection for those with preexisting conditions, LGBTQ rights, money in politics, and workers’ rights. Thank you to our brave NV firefighters working tirelessly to migitage the active fires around our state. We must all remain vigilant & be mindful of steps we can take to prevent a wildfire. Please stay safe, all, & alert authorities if you see something you think could be a fire. … Had a great tour last week at the Panaca Heritage Center in Lincoln County, learning about the museum's work to preserve historic buildings and artifacts from the early pioneer settlers of NV. Fun fact: Panaca was southern NV's first permanent settlement, founded in 1864!pic.twitter.com/BTiJt9CgNj .@realDonaldTrump's relentless with his #ACAsabotage - & now, he's delivered another blow. Insurers agree - ending payments under the risk-adjustment program will cause more uncertainty in the marketplace & increase premiums. Healthcare should be made more accessible, not less. … Let's be clear #WhatsAtStake with the #SCOTUSnominee pick: A woman's right to choose.   70% of the country supports #RoevWade. Yet, @realDonaldTrump's mission is to overturn it. The stakes couldn't be higher. Now, we must fight like hell to protect a woman's fundamental right. All of the nominees on @realDonaldTrump’s short list would overturn #RoevWade and key healthcare protections.  That’s why the extreme right put them on the list in the first place. #WhatsAtAStakepic.twitter.com/BYRPF3BXI8 Once again, the Trump administration ignores science & facts to side with corporate special interests over the well-being of children. Mothers & families should have access to all of the facts when making healthcare decisions for their babies. … Acting Administrator Wheeler is just another special interest lobbyist on top that's in the back pocket of #BigPolluters. We need leaders who will work to ensure the air we breathe & water we drink, is clean. We need leaders who will protect Americans - not the special interests. While I'm glad to see Scott Pruitt's long overdue departure - we must rally just as hard against @EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. As an avid climate change denier & former coal lobbyist, Andrew Wheeler is just as corrupt & dangerous as Pruitt was. Each day the Trump administration fails to reunite children with their families at our southern border is another day they spend terrified & traumatized. This is unacceptable. This admin needs to work harder to fix the crisis they are fully responsible for … This is exciting! Took over 30 years for it to come to fruition. Veterans Parkway will now connect south Reno and Sparks. … Had a great time kicking off the holiday this morning at the White Pine County Independence Day community breakfast in Ely!

This was one of the proudest moments in our history. Yet, despite the progress made, we must continue to fight to protect civil rights - especially now with the future of #SCOTUS on the line. … Even though 70% of the country supports Roe v. Wade, President Trump has made overturning Roe v. Wade a litmus test for his nominees. Let the voters have a say in who will be the next justice at the ballot box this November. #WhatsAtStake Proud to see all who came out in Reno to send a clear message to @realDonaldTrump: separating kids from their parents & holding thousands of children behind bars indefinitely is unacceptable, inhumane, & not what America stands for! #KeepFamiliesTogether … What a powerful weekend of people across the country showing up to say that #FamiliesBelongTogether! There were more than 750 events, w/ 35,000 people in DC; over 60,000 in Chicago; over 30,000 in NYC; over 30,000 in San Francisco & over 55,000 in LA. There's no other way to put this: a woman's right to choose is #WhatsAtStake with the recent #SCOTUS vacancy. A woman's healthcare decisions is between her & and her doctor, period. We must raise our voices together - & fight to protect one of our most fundamental rights! … I stand with all marchers across the country - especially those in NV - taking a stand against @realDonaldTrump's heinous border policy that flies in the face of our American values. We will not rest until every family is reunited & treated with humanity! #FamilesBelongTogether If you are attending a #FamiliesBelongTogether rally today, know your rights via @ACLU #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarchpic.twitter.com/dTwe5g9oWz We know #CourtsMatter & the next #SCOTUS justice could eviscerate the rights of workers to organize & bargain collectively for a fair wage. We must make our voices heard & protect the future of our Supreme Court! Pleasure meeting with Col. Cheater, Wing Commander of @Creech_AFB and the Creech leadership team this week. Glad to advocate for your drone pilot program in this year's and the last NDAA bill. I will always fight to ensure you have the resources & tools needed.pic.twitter.com/6Ikny5bvcT Given evidence by the Chinese gov't to undermine democratic institutions in the U.S., it's critical we protect our nat'l security.

This announcement will serve as a great boost to Reno's tourism economy. … #TitleX funding is what millions rely on for affordable, preventative care & family planning services. @realDonaldTrump's #gagrule is another pathetic attempt by him to defund @PPFA. That's why I joined @SenFeinstein & other Senate Dems in a letter, calling on him to abandon it. I applaud the Department of Interior for awarding nearly $27 million to NV's rural counties through the PILT program—an increase of $800k from last year. These funds are vital to local gov'ts to provide essential services & enable local leaders to invest in development projects. That's right @amyklobuchar. Stricter penalties with robocalls & enforcement are needed to protect Americans from being defrauded by those who are knowingly violating the law. Our DO NOT Call Act will help ensure it. Thanks for joining us too @SenSchumer @clairecmc @SenatorHassan … NV's police, first responders, fire fighters, & law enforcement have worked tirelessly to help our community recover from the #1October massacre. I'm glad they will be fully reimbursed with $2 million from DOJ. I'll continue to do all I can to support them … Nevadans have spoken loud & clear: they do not want a nuclear waste dump in their backyard. Glad my request to exclude #YuccaMountain funding in the 2019 Energy & Water Development Approps bill was granted. I'll continue to fight to ensure Yucca remains a hole in the ground. The Colorado River is vital to the health & well-being of NV's families & economy. I'm proud to help guarantee the continuation of the System Conservation Pilot Program through language I inserted in the 2019 Energy & Water Development Appropriations bill passed this week. Whoever fills the #SCOTUS seat could upend over 40 years of precedent & drag America back to a time when women could be prosecuted as criminals for exercising their reproductive rights. It's going to take us all to protect a woman's right to choose, so make make your voices heard This morning was the Change of Command Ceremony for the 99th Medical Group of @NellisAFB at Mike O'Callaghan Military Medical Center. Thank you to Colonel Virginia Garner for your incredible service and a big welcome to Colonel Alfred Flowers Jr.pic.twitter.com/Le9WiwLKPV Over 2,000 children woke up at our southern border today terrified & desperate for their parents.

This IS what democracy looks like!pic.twitter.com/s9LUrOlnRE Proud my & @senrobportman's amendment to create a permanent interagency rural council that would ensure NV's rural needs are heard was included in the Senate #FarmBill2018. Our amendment will encourage smart growth & the innovative use of technology in rural areas. NEW POD: Kennedy retires, McConnell plots, @Ocasio2018 wins, and @SenCortezMasto joins to talk about SCOTUS and her trip to the border:  Let me be clear: a woman's right to choose is on the line with our vacant #SCOTUS seat. And now, we need to fight like hell to protect that right.   More in my interview with @PodSaveAmerica on #SCOTUS & my recent trip to the southern border. … Heartbroken over the developing news out of Annapolis, MD. My heart is with the families of all of those impacted by this horrific event. We must work together to end the gun violence across this country. When will enough be enough? … This admin must outline a clear plan for how they're reuniting these separated families & ensure there's regular phone contact with one another. The Trump admin needs to fix the crisis they created. Our legislation will hold them accountable & ensure these families are reunited. … We're four months away from an election. We must allow the new Congress that'll be seated in January to weigh in on a #SCOTUSnominee. We must wait until the American people have a say, especially when a woman's right to choose is on the line. #SaveSCOTUS … I'll be following up w/ the VA on the IG's findings that the Southern NV Healthcare System referred vets in need of prosthetic care to outside vendors, despite having a sufficient supply. We must ensure tax dollars are spent wisely & vets get quality care  … Our immigration system should show the world who we are. It should never be used as a tool to spread fear or punish parents for doing what they know is right for their kids. @realDonaldTrump's border policy flies in the face of this. My @marieclaire op-ed … Another completely disturbing & heartbreaking result of @realDonaldTrump's border policy.  Listen to a 7-yo boy, who's been separated from his family for nearly a month, as he breaks down speaking with his mother. We must continue to fight for these kids. … We must use every tool we have to ensure we’re fighting for a qualified, balanced, & independent-minded nominee. We must also fight to ensure the American people’s voices are heard in the November elections & only consider a #SCOTUS nominee after the new Congress is seated. But let me be clear here: Nothing less than a woman's right to choose is on the line with this vacant Supreme Court seat. Justice Kennedy honored his oath to support & defend our Constitution & faithfully discharged his duties as a Justice on the #SCOTUS for 30 years. While I have not agreed with every decision he has signed his name to, I honor his service & wish him the best in his retirement. We are a country of values & laws. One of the things we value are our children. Whether they’re ours or someone else’s. We do no harm to children. What the Trump admin's doing at the border flies in the face of this. More from my border trip w/ @KNPRnews … .@SenCortezMasto seeks answers at the border. Finds few. My dispatch w/ @GarrettHaake … This decision will weaken working people's ability to join together in unions to improve their workplaces & collectively bargain for the benefits they’ve earned. I'll continue to fight for middle & working class families. The rights of union workers must remain strong & protected Unions have always been a powerful voice for better wages, safe working conditions, & equal pay for equal work. Today’s #SCOTUS #JANUSvsAFSCME decision hurts American workers & will further economic inequality in America. … On Monday, I tried getting into a "tender age" detention facility in Brownsville, Texas. I was denied access. Red flags went up everywhere. What's this admin hiding? What's their plan to reunite these families? We need answers. More from my border trip --> … This decision allows @realDonaldTrump to continue threatening the lives of vulnerable women across America. Women deserve to know the qualifications, or lack thereof, of the ‘providers’ who they turn to for support in making their health care decisions. … Three years ago today, #SCOTUS ruled in favor of the right of every American to marry the person they love. While this was incredible progress in our fight for equality & acceptance for all, we must continue to fight. And always push back against hatred & intolerance. #LoveWinspic.twitter.com/ljoNGZKwr3 The chaos & trauma I witnessed at the border falls solely on @realDonaldTrump's shoulders. The stories I heard were gut-wrenching. We must fight to ensure these families are reunited, treated w/ humanity, & get a fair chance to make their case before a judge. More from my day --> … Our immigration system should show the world who we are. It should never, ever be used as a tool to spread fear or punish parents for doing what they believe is right for their kids. If you agree with me, learn what you can do in my op-ed with @marieclaire … This #SCOTUS decision flies in the face of our nation’s founding principle of religious freedom. @realDonaldTrump's #MuslimBan serves only to incite recruiting for ISIS & undermines efforts to protect our country. This is not who we are as Americans. … There's a disconnect b/t what the Trump admin is telling us - & what is currently happening on the ground. @HHSGov @DHSgov said @ICEgov Port Isabel Detention Facility would be the family reunification center. I was there yesterday. The staff had no idea. … Yesterday, I was at the southern border in Texas. The stories I heard - & the conditions in which immigrants are being detained in - were absolutely horrific. I'll never forget it. We must continue to demand answers from this admin. We must demand every family be reunited now. … Red Flag Warnings have been issued for western NV and NE CA which go in effect on Monday. Wind gusts of 35-40 mph are possible with humidity levels in the low teens to single digits. Make sure to read over the “Fire Prevention Checklist” to avoid any fire starters. #NVWx #CAWxpic.twitter.com/JvlwC8FQCe Here's a recap from my day at the border. As I sit at the airport, I am overwhelmed by what I saw & the stories I heard today. The most heartbreaking: parents still having no idea where their children are. We must keep fighting. We must ensure this admin reunites these families.pic.twitter.com/WzVrohZE8H The choice of the detainees I spoke to was to either stay in their home country & be killed - or their children be killed & raped - or come to this country where we have asylum laws. Pres. Trump has done away w/ this now & it's not who we are as a country … The detainees @ICEgov Port Isabel Detention Facility told me that authorities would change the TV channel when news about family separation came on. When I told them that a majority of this country knows what this admin is doing - & are outraged - they smiled. They had no idea. I'm not sure how anybody could not have listened to the stories I heard & have a dry eye - & not want to protect these kids & reunify them w/ their families. These mothers were told either you put your child on a bus or @ICEgov is going to. Makes me sick what this admin has done. On the road: @GarrettHaake trading in the basement of the Russell Senate Office Building for the passenger seat of a car covering @SenCortezMasto's visits to border detention centers in Texas:pic.twitter.com/uHVeThExNk Every story was heartbreaking, but THIS is what alarmed me most after speaking with these women: There are other mothers who are locked up in holding cells next to them that are STILL talking about families being separated.   My God. I hope not. @realDonaldTrump, is this true? "If they know where the children are, they sure as hell are not making an opportunity for them to have contact with their parents, right?...These parents have no idea what's going on and they have been here almost two weeks." "I don't know how anyone can listen to those stories and not feel outrage that we in this country have decided that it's ok as a deterrent to separate these young kids from their mothers and their fathers. It's outrageous to me." You don't see @SenCortezMasto, the first Latina in the Senate, get outraged in public very often. But check out the video: "One question from the father to the mother that they ask, 'When are we going to be reunited with our kids? It was heartbreaking." "It looks like a prison facility." --- @SenCortezMasto after emerging from the Port Isabel Detention Facility. Our @MichelleRindels and @LuzGrayNV are there and got her on tape. Some harrowing stuff.  … Here's there updated dispatch:  …pic.twitter.com/4wMESaLAnT The six women & three men I met with have all been separated from their children & most have no idea where they are.

Some of them haven’t even talked to attorneys yet.” (: @PoloSandovalCNN)pic.twitter.com/vUY4XUbvpE I spoke with mothers who have all been separated from their kids. Their kids are all under age 12. Most of them hadn't heard from their kids in weeks, or even know where they are. They told me they have not heard of any process to reunite them. Pres. Trump, this is unacceptable! I just came from the Port Isabel @ICEgov Detention Facility were I spoke with mothers who fled to the U.S. because of gang violence. Some lost family members to gang violence. They left their home country to seek asylum because they were terrified they - or their kids - were nextpic.twitter.com/gmsgEsdCOn I was scheduled to visit this children's detention facility in Brownsville, Texas but was asked to leave immediately. Something is happening here that they don't want the public to know.pic.twitter.com/ogTM5VX1tk I'm headed to an @ICEgov facility in Los Fresnos to try & speak with parents who have been separated from their children by this admin. Do they know where their kids are? Have they been in contact with them? When will they be reunited? They deserve these answers, @realDonaldTrump Reporting today from along the Texas-Mexico border. @SenCortezMasto was turned away from Casa Presidente, a Brownsville shelter, run by a nonprofit, that has been housing kids and babies who were separated from their parents. … In Brownsville, TX @SenCortezMasto denied access to a facility holding migrant kids. Lawmakers have been frustrated by lack of access/oversight to facilities like this along border.pic.twitter.com/498slkpfMW .@SenCortezMasto acaba de solicitar acceso a Casa Presidente, donde se encuentran algunos niños inmigrantes.

We’re calling on all of our reps to act now to reunite families and keep innocent children and families out of prison camps. #FamiliesBelongTogether … Organizations like @OurCenterReno is crucial to providing resources & empowerment to members of the LGBTQ community, who need support when discriminated against with housing, employment, & signing up for healthcare services. Grateful for the tour & insight during our roundtable.pic.twitter.com/WNOMw0foNx I'm grateful to see this mother & child reunited, but it shouldn't have had to happen to begin with. @realDonaldTrump's heartless policy of separating families at the border will leave permanent emotional scars on them for a lifetime. This admin must reunite every family now. … The Nevada Urban Indians nonprofit provides comprehensive social services to northern NV's Native American communities - including medical care, victim advocacy, substance abuse & suicide prevention counseling as well as housing & food support. Thank you for the tour & all you dopic.twitter.com/W1HuXB3Wqg NV voters made it clear they favor regulation & taxation of marijuana in our state. The federal gov't must respect the rights of states who choose to legalize & regulate marijuana. That's why I'm a proud original cosponsor of the #STATESAct to ensure it. … Wow. Complete chaos. This admin needs to do whatever it takes to reunite these kids with their families!   This dark chapter @realDonaldTrump has written in our nation's history will be with us for generations. Certainly not the America my grandfather crossed the Rio Grande for. … Defense Secretary Mattis said what we've all been saying - North Korea has not taken any steps to denuclearize. @realDonaldTrump needs to back his claims up with real actions on denuclearization. … .@DeptVetAffairs must continue to monitor the conditions our aging veterans live in & work to improve the quality of care provided in poorly run nursing facilities. I intro'd an amendment that requires the IG to conduct an investigation of VA nursing homes with a one-star rating.pic.twitter.com/qTgZStD0iS To be clear: the Executive Order @realDonaldTrump signed was him doubling down on his heinous anti-immigrant agenda. Thousands of children are still separated from their parents, some in tents & behind bars. We must continue to demand the admin reunite these families immediately. I applaud those airlines that have chosen morality & humanity over profits. And refusing to take any part in helping execute this admin's anti-family, anti-immigrant agenda. Cc: @AmericanAir @UnitedAirways @SouthwestAir @FlyFrontier @Delta @SpiritAirlines … You can guarantee I'll continue to fight like hell to get to the truth - & demand the Trump admin reunite these children with their families.   The President better believe I'm not giving up here. I'll go the mats for these kids. That's why I'll be at the border on Monday. … If we can find hope in one thing, it is knowing that all the calls and emails and letters—all that outcry—got through to the President to change course on one of his most heartless policies yet. But we can’t let up now. .@SecNielsen has supported Pres. Trump's heinous border policy & anti-immigrant agenda every step of the way. Any person that believes ripping a child from its parents' arms - & detaining them - is no leader at all.   It's time for @SecNielsen to resign. … I, along with many, have been completely horrified & heartbroken over what's happening to families at our southern border. This admin has manufactured a crisis using kids as political bargaining chips for their own political gain. It's egregious & immoral. … Thanks to all for speaking out. But let us remember - this admin still has NO plan to reunite the thousands of children who were separated from their parents. We must continue to demand this admin reunite these families & that they're treated with compassion & not like prisoners .@realDonaldTrump's Executive Order still maintains his "zero tolerance" policy that prosecutes asylum-seeking parents - those fleeing extreme violence to save their kids' lives. Let's be clear, the President doubled down here. This will still keep children behind bars. MORE -->pic.twitter.com/3cPyJ9oVaJ To be clear, the Trump admin has no plan to reunify thousands of children with their parents - & many have no idea where each other are or if they're okay. And the conditions they're being detained in are still barbaric. I'll be at the southwest border Monday to see it for myself On #WorldRefugeeDay, I strongly urge the Trump administration to heed the words of Pope Francis as the humanitarian crisis they created at our southwest border gets more heinous & inhumane by the day. #FamiliesBelongTogther … Last night on @Lawrence I said I saw babies alone in cages at the processing center in McAllen.  Just learned more: it's a play area for mostly tender aged kids *without* parents, supervised by contractors in a watch tower.  Border Patrol didn't explain that on the tour.

MORE:  pic.twitter.com/k2g3QIqPOg Just learned from HHS that there are 94 children in the Homestead, Florida facility who were separated from their families. The Trump administration’s actions today to block us from checking on these kids is inexcusable. This is not a good day for our country. The Trump administration will not let us check on the welfare of the children being held in Homestead, FL. These are kids who were taken from their moms and dads. They are scared. And this administration should be ashamed of itself.pic.twitter.com/DbrknSuEIT The company running this facility told us we would be welcomed to tour the facility. HHS then denied us entry and said that they need “two weeks notice” to allow us inside. That’s ridiculous and it’s clear this administration is hiding something. My & @SenatorCollins' BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act sets the tone that this is a public health crisis & we're creating an infrastructure that's necessary for that coordinated plan that's needed.

He says he "hates to see separation of parents & children" - but let's be honest: the only thing he hates more is working with Democrats to keep them together #FamiliesBelongTogether Republican leadership continues to ignore the bipartisan solutions right in front of them in favor of purely partisan tactics, just to throw red meat at their base.

Azar on what his agency is doing to ensure that kids being cruelly ripped from their parents' arms at the border are safe & what his plans for reunification are. We won't stop demanding answers because #FamiliesBelongTogether … I'm encouraged to see diplomatic negotiations take place, but it would be foolish to trust a regime that's broken the same promises before. Until we see progress, sanctions must remain & the admin must develop & share with Congress a clear & robust plan on how they'd implement it AG Sessions' reversal of this important - & sometimes lifesaving - precedent closes the door on thousands of vulnerable people threatened by violence. Sending refugees back to their home countries is a death sentence. This sickens me & isn't who we are. … Two years ago today, 49 people were shot and killed, and more than 50 were injured by a hate-filled gunman at #Pulse, an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Orlando, Florida.

There aren't many bipartisan solutions to big problems in Washington these days, but the Senate's bipartisan CRA to #SaveTheInternet is one! @SpeakerRyan just needs to bring it to a vote b/c the internet belongs to us all. Nations around the globe do seek to influence public opinion & policy debates beyond their borders. But the Chinese efforts go well beyond this. I led a bipartisan letter to the Trump admin urging them to craft a comprehensive strategy to counter this. … 55 years after President Kennedy signed the #EqualPayAct on this day, gender wage discrimination still exists. The pay disparity hampers women's ability to help provide for their families. It's past time Congress pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to close the gender pay gap.

But @realDonaldTrump's relentless efforts to sabotage this law is hurting Nevadans. And they deserve better. After hearing from patients & advocates today, I'm more committed than ever to ensuring we protect itpic.twitter.com/KkCr7RpGOl Thank you @MomsDemand @Everytown for your conversation in Las Vegas today. Your advocacy in working to end gun violence couldn't be more important. I stand with you in calling on Congress to step up & pass legislation that will help to end gun violence & save lives.pic.twitter.com/QWCWFjRSFV Thanks to @realDonaldTrump's #ACA sabotage, junk plans have been extended & healthcare premiums are skyrocketing across the country.

As part of my #InnovationState agenda, I have two bills that will help solve this. Read more in my op-ed --> … Congratulations to Battle Mountain High School for placing 10th in @SIFMAFoundation's 2018 #CapitolHillChallenge! I was proud to sponsor you - & Skype with the team to learn more about it last month. What a great way to round out the school year! .@BetsyDeVosED comments this week on leaving it to schools to decide whether to report undocumented children are plain wrong & completely reckless. Every child in this country has a right to a basic education, regardless of their immigration status. Period … In 2015, #TitleX provided contraceptive care for 3.8 million women. And in NV alone, there were 17 #TitleX family planning clinics that received funding, providing care for 10,310 women. @realDonaldTrump's move to gut this funding is an attack on women's health & freedoms.pic.twitter.com/HekBiut5rc Welcome, Colonel Craddock! And a big thank you to Colonel Murray for your outstanding work at Nellis AFB & in the southern NV community. … In NV alone, a recent study predicts premium costs for Nevadans on the healthcare exchanges would cost them an additional $843 next year. Hardworking NV families cannot take on costs like this. And we have @realDonaldTrump's #ACA sabotage to thank for it. … Did you know that the renewal process for #DACA is still available for some? Visit @UnitedWeDream’s website and learn all about the resources you need. #HereToStay -->  All #DACA recipients need to know the information available to them about renewals. @UnitedWeDream has created this website to help you navigate this difficult process. #HereToStay -->  “We are here today to send a clear message: Separating parents from their children is unacceptable.” Thank you for bold words today, @SenCortezMasto #EndFamilySeparation #KeepFamiliesTogether This bill would also not have been possible without the help of Rules Committee Members @SenFeinstein @SenCortezMasto @SenCapito @SenatorFischer whose dedication to this issue was critical to getting it done. –AK .@SenCortezMasto: I will not stand by while this Administration continues to attack immigrant families — he rescinded DACA and TPS ... and he is separating kids from their parents.

I will not stand by while this administration attacks families like mine"@SenCortezMasto #ProtectFamilies #EndFamilySeparation Hotel & casino workers work behind the scenes & in the front of the house to keep our city thriving - & showing why Las Vegas hospitality is the best in the world. Our workers deserve to have their rights upheld & to demand better working conditions & better pay. … We appreciate the @NCAA suspending its championship host policy. But @SenatorMenendez & I urge a permanent change to be made, which would provide certainty in the bidding & hosting process moving forward. … Excited Las Vegas' first @WNBA team will be playing in Washington, DC tonight! You know who'll be rooting for. Go, @LVAces! … Foreign investments help grow our economy & promote jobs, but they must be met with responsible oversight. Countries like China use investment to undermine our security. I’m proud my amendments protect our military bases, businesses, & democratic institutions from those threats.pic.twitter.com/XeNZ8OfFtx Proud to support your amendment in the Banking Committee, @ChrisVanHollen. China’s ZTE violated U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea. This Administration is trading our national security for an empty trade deal that will only benefit Chinese workers. … We cannot turn a blind eye to the absolute human horrors of the conflict in #Syria. The U.S. has spent $14 billion to defeat #ISIS there.  It's imperative that @realDonaldTrump present Congress with a clear strategy for Syria. Yesterday, I introduced legislation calling for it. The Consumer Bureau was created to level the playing field & empower consumers to make informed financial decisions. The public nature of the database is critical to making this system work. Recently, I joined in a letter calling on #Mulvaney to protect it … It’s reprehensible the Consumer Bureau has no interest in fulfilling its mission to protect consumers & is instead looking out for the special interests. Americans should be offered the same rates based on their credit; not terms based on their skin color. … Though Congress has yet to appropriate any funds to the NRC around #YuccaMountain, I'm concerned the NRC is moving in a direction to use allocated funds for a purpose that hasn't been authorized. I sent a letter to the NRC Chairman asking her to outline the NRC's intentions.pic.twitter.com/u44euVgwUz Mandatory arbitration does not only favor employers, it also disproportionately affects women and minority employees.  This decision is a step backward. Congress must act to ensure employees can collectively enforce their rights. … Amazing!! Congratulations, @GoldenKnights! … The Golden Knights will hold a moment of silence before today’s game in honor of the victims, families and all those affected by today’s tragedy at Santa Fe High School.   We offer our condolences to the Santa Fe community. Our hearts are with you. Thank you, @SenCortezMasto! Our graduates so appreciated their certificates of recognition this morning! #AHealthyNevada #UNRMed50 #PackPride … Happy 50th Anniversary, @unrmed! Thank you for leading the way to better health for Nevadans across the state. And congratulations to the graduates of the #Classof2018! #UNRMed50 #PackPride Hoping folks got to take advantage of the exciting new @limebike fleet in Reno on #BikeToWorkDay! Glad my staff was able to attend the launch this week. This year-long pilot will provide many with the opportunity to watch their carbon footprint, while getting some exercise, too!pic.twitter.com/tX5TEAL39y Here we go again. @realDonaldTrump continues his war on women's health. This is an attack on @PPFA & an attack on every women's right to choose. A women's healthcare decision is between her & her doctor - & them alone. No politician - or @POTUS - has a right to stand between that … Heartbreaking news out of Santa Fe, Texas. My heart goes out to the students, faculty, and their families. Once again, another community is left devastated by gun violence. When will enough be enough? This must end. Individuals overcome with addiction shouldn't be met with fake recovery programs & harmful treatment scams. By empowering the FTC & state attorneys general to punish bad actors, my & @SenCapito's bill will help ensure addiction victims have access to safe, effective treatments. … I welcome this news from @NCAA suspending their championship host policy. Last year myself, @SenatorMenendez & @SenBooker called on @NCAA to reevaluate its position preventing championship play in sports betting states. Soon, I'll be calling on them to make this change permanent. … On Infrastructure Workers Appreciation Day, we thank our transportation workers for their hard work in building & maintaining our roads, highways, & bridges that we travel on every day. It is past time we address some of our nation's crumbling infrastructure in a bipartisan way. My friend Catherine, a terrific senator, is spot on. The President’s remarks are despicable and should be universally condemned in the strongest possible terms. America is better than this—much better. … On the 64th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s historic decision in Brown v. Board, the Senate Judiciary Committee is considering two nominees who would not state that the decision ending racial segregation in schools was correctly decided. That’s disturbing. #GinaHaspel chose to be an accessory to the CIA's illegal & unconstitutional torture regime, supporting waterboarding, & the outright humiliation of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison. Her complicity darkened the light of our legal system & rule of law to the entire world. I voted no … Immigrants are part of what makes our country great, and just like you and me – they are people who deserve compassion and respect. … This isn't the Salem witch trials. This is about protecting the integrity of our elections. It's about ensuring Mueller's ability to find the truth. And @SenatorBurr says Russia interfered in our elections.   @SenateMajLdr, the time is now to bring #ProtectMueller bill for a vote … That's right @SenJoniErnst. The commission proposed in our bill will provide guidance on how we cultivate AI to help ensure we stay ahead of countries like China in this space, while also building guardrails to make certain the U.S. gov't responsibly uses artificial intelligence … My father fled Nazi Germany to come to America—a country of tolerance, freedom, and opportunity. President Trump’s ugly language is a disgraceful betrayal of those values. … You can disagree about immigration policies, but it’s dangerous and unconscionable to call human beings ‘animals’ as @realDonaldTrump did yesterday. This President has a horrific pattern of inflaming hate & dehumanizing minorities. We must all stand up against this bigotry. .@realDonaldTrump, would you speak that way about your ancestors? Let me tell you something: When you attack immigrants, you're attacking me. You're attacking my grandfather who crossed the Rio Grande to pursue the American Dream. RT to tell Pres. Trump you stand with immigrants! … Powerful message during #NationalPoliceWeek @WashoeSheriff. NV's police officers work tirelessly to make sure our communities are safe & secure. Their hard work, courage, & sacrifice should not go unnoticed. We are grateful to you. … Couldn't agree more, @JRosenworcel! … We know the environmental benefits to fuel efficient cars. But Nevadans want more fuel efficient cars to save them money, too. I've met with automakers who've stressed that they don't want to roll back auto CAFE standards. I pressed the NHTSA Administrator nom on the Admin's planpic.twitter.com/Re7qbj9SZl If #YuccaMountain were to be revived, it wouldn't just be Nevadans' backyards that would turn into a nuclear waste dump. 75-90% of the nuclear waste would travel by rail across the country. Today, an NTSB nominee confirmed that if an accident happened "it could be devastating."pic.twitter.com/uWlH77KU8c Not if we can help it! Thank you to all of you that raised your voice to protect #NetNeutrality, we got the votes we needed for it to pass. But this fight isn't over, we must keep the pressure on the House to vote to save a free & open internet as we know it. Keep speaking out! … SOON, the #Senate will be voting on a bill that would save #NetNeutrality. If there were ever a time to raise your voice to save a free & open internet, that time is now!

That's why I need YOU to raise your voice to help democrats save the free & open internet as we know it!pic.twitter.com/3Sbkd0w4Fc I expect members of @realDonaldTrump's Cabinet to challenge his decisions when they're wrong, & reject his worst instincts & ignorance. In my view, #GinaHaspel is not up to that job & will not have my vote.pic.twitter.com/zdLldl8wjS I'm proud to co-sponsor a resolution recognizing #NationalPoliceWeek, including honoring Chad Parque & Charleston Hartfield, NV officers killed in the line of the duty last year. NV's police officers have saved countless lives, as we saw on #1October & the weeks that followed. On this day in 1905, Las Vegas was officially founded as a city. And aren't we glad it was?   A happy birthday to my hometown!pic.twitter.com/6M662h9UVC .@realDonaldTrump wants to help ZTE “get back into business." That means: spying on America’s military & intel community, stealing U.S. intellectual property, & shirking Iran & North Korea sanctions. I’m calling on the Administration to protect our national security & economy. … It's concerning that Hispanics make up just 7% of #tech employees. Diversity makes us stronger, & it makes our tech companies more competitive & profitable. I stand with the @HispanicCaucus in calling for #DIVERSITYinTECH. #LATISM Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on a CRA to save #NetNeutrality.

He beat his opponents in the boxing ring, took on the mob in Nevada, and moved bills in the Senate that no one believed could be done. He'll beat cancer too. I wish him a speedy and successful recovery. #DoddFrankRollback repealed critical housing reporting requirements that shed light on lending discrimination. My amendment would have protected them. This report shows it's still happening at an alarming rate. This is plain wrong & we need to address it. … We're on the clock.

Thank you to the spouses of our military who also make incredible sacrifices everyday. Today - & everyday - we are grateful to you. #MilitarySpouseAppreciationDay … Pleased to see the FCC is aggressively enforcing the law against abusive & unlawful robocalls. I’ve cosponsored a bill to give the FTC more time to pursue robocallers & am drafting legislation that increases penalties for those who violate the law. … Teachers have one of the toughest jobs out there. They give their all, so our childrens' futures can be bright. On #TeacherAppreciationWeek, we thank you for your hard work. But also recommit ourselves to ensuring teachers are paid fairly & have access to the resources they need. Pleased to hear @USDOT's Inspector General heeded our calls for an examination into the FAA’s oversight of airline maintenance.

Sad I missed it, but glad my Reno staff was able to attend "The Biggest Little Birthday" to commemorate @CityofReno's 150th Birthday! … Let's be clear: This move will result in vulnerable student loan borrowers to be taken advantage of & misled even more. The Consumer Bureau was created to protect consumers, not the special interests in #Mulvaney's back pocket. Once again, he has no business "leading" this agency … .@SenSchumer agrees. #YuccaMountain is dead on arrival here in the Senate.pic.twitter.com/lUCb3avnty Let me repeat: #YuccaMountain is dead. And will never see the light of day. … The House can vote all they want to revive #YuccaMountain, but let's be clear - any bill that would turn Nevadans' backyards into a nuclear waste dump is dead on arrival. Yucca will never be anything more than a hole in the ground. … NV's leading the way in innovative tech - @Fly_Flirtey's pioneering new ways to save lives.

And now to help pay for it, @realDonaldTrump wants to cut children's healthcare that millions of families rely on.   Is there no level he won't stoop to? … NV's public libraries provide internet access to folks who might not have access in their homes.

Does the @CFPB have a price tag too? -SB  …pic.twitter.com/cM4jC7wG0o This revelation undercuts the core mission of @CFPB - an independent agency that's there to protect consumers' interests, not the special interests who have shoveled money into its leaders' pocket to get what they want. Once again, proof Mulvaney has no business leading the @CFPB Mulvaney admitted to his 1,300 closest banker friends that his Congressional office sold access to lobbyists who contributed to his campaign. This is the definition of "pay to play" & corruption. We all need to know if he's taking the same approach @CFPB & if he's still for sale. … Pompeo has a history of advocating for reckless & ignorant policies that put our troops at risk & undermine our values. He also has a troubling history of refusing to acknowledge human rights for LGBTQ communities. We need someone that will stand up to @POTUS. Pompeo isn't it. Paul & I send our deepest condolences to the family of Sen. Dean Rhoads. He was a tireless public servant for over 30 years & a champion for the needs of rural Nevada. He was a class act & his service will always be remembered. The Rubies in Elko County, NV, welcomes thousands of visitors every year to hunt, fish, & enjoy its pristine terrain. But now, the Trump Admin wants to sell it off to #BigOil. I pressed @forestservice Interim Chief to ensure local constituents' input will be counted during reviewpic.twitter.com/ylTB3D2ex1 Are the Koch brothers calling the shots in the Trump Administration? I'm heading to the Senate floor to call out the Koch-funded groups pushing a dangerous agenda. #WebofDeceit   WATCH LIVE:  … The Kochs want us to believe that climate change is a hoax b/c protecting the environment hurts their bottom line. Members of their network fill the ranks in the admin. I've joined @SenWhitehouse inquiring whether they're influencing decisions that effect our health & environment … When the head of NV's health insurance exchange sounds the alarm on @realDonaldTrump's federal rule change extending the length of "junk plans", we should take pause. I joined my Dem colleagues in a letter to the Admin urging them to halt this proposal. … Today, I wrote to @forestservice expressing deep concern over the prospect of opening the Rubies up to #BigOil & gas drilling. Nevadans take great pride in our beautiful landscapes. Enjoying our public lands is a way of life in NV. We must protect them for generations to come.pic.twitter.com/0plsFXSyuf Nevada's public lands are part of who we are. We must do whatever we can to protect them. We cannot allow the Ruby Mountains to be sold off to #BigOil & gas companies.   The comment period to share your thoughts on the Rubies ends tonight -->  …pic.twitter.com/cIQ7SXpVb3 Today, the safeguards we have to a fair & open internet officially ends. With the leadership of @SenMarkey, @SenateDems have a plan to save #NetNeutrality & all we need is one more Republican to join us on the CRA! We must ensure every American has equal access to the internet.pic.twitter.com/s2VKDQUPnO The Rubies are one of the most stunning landscapes I've ever seen. They're iconic in NV & I was lucky to visit them last year. But now, the Trump admin is working to sell them off to #BigOil & gas.   The comment period on the Ruby Mountains ends today -->  …pic.twitter.com/z9dIadYR88 Plans that don't cover prescription drug costs, maternity care, or basic health screenings - & lead to higher costs for people with pre-existing conditions are #JunkPlans. The comment period for @realDonaldTrump's #JunkPlans proposal ends at 5pm ET today:  …pic.twitter.com/f1ffr1omkL On 4/23, President Trump's FCC vote to repeal net neutrality protections will go into effect - further jeopardizing a fair & open internet. @SenateDems have a plan to save #NetNeutrality & all we need is one more Republican to join us. But we need your voices to get it done!pic.twitter.com/x4aPz4cfVN Congratulations, @CSNCoyote on receiving the distinguished National Center of Academic Excellence in cyber defense education from @DHSgov @NSAGov! This funding will help create a 30% job increase in cybersecurity skills through 2022. Excellent news! … You're right. 19 years after #Columbine - the epidemic of gun violence plagues our country & yet, Congress does nothing. To all the young people participating in #NationalSchoolWalkoutDay, I hear your voices. Keep speaking out. Keep demanding action. You will change our country.  … We must do more to help Puerto Rico recover & rebuild. They deserve a reliable power grid. But tens of 1000s lacked power before the blackout. We also need to extend the foreclosure moratorium. People can't pay their mortgage if they're living in the dark.  … Congratulations, @CCOutdoorNA Las Vegas for receiving the FBI Director Community Leadership Award. Your donating billboard space in the aftermath of the #1October shooting led to thousands of calls with info & tips. We are grateful for your kindness during an extremely tough time … We must ensure banks, credit unions, & lenders follow the law before taking a home. Borrowers are being put at risk of losing their homes because of servicers' failures to comply with certain FHA requirements. Thanks @SenWarren @RepMaxineWaters for being champions in this effort. NV felt the housing crisis worse than any other state. As AG, I saw too many lives devastated because of rampant foreclosures. Today, I introduced the FHA Foreclosure Prevention Act that will implement common-sense measures to give borrowers a fair chance at avoiding foreclosure This is an exciting day in the Senate. We are eager to welcome you, Maile! @SenDuckworth, you are an inspiration to working mothers everywhere. Family-friendly work policies are critical & I am glad the Senate unanimously adopted a very important one last night. … Hundreds of millions of dollars from special interests have been donated to inaugural committees, but because of loopholes in the law, the American people have no idea how it's spent. My Inaugural Committee Transparency Act will bring much needed transparency & accountability. … .@SenatorHassan, Senator Kaine, @SenCortezMasto and @SenWhitehouse are all in on saving #NetNeutrality!   Help @SenateDems find just one more Republican Senator to support the CRA resolution. Now is the time to make your voices heard! #OneMoreVotepic.twitter.com/m6AvDjwsB8 I joined a group of 39 senators, led by @SenatorTomUdall, & 131 representatives calling on @EPAScottPruitt to step down. Our historic resolution sends an unequivocal message to the administration: the American people have lost faith in Pruitt & it’s time for him to go #BootPruittpic.twitter.com/ZQYTkOFHMZ Earlier this year, @SenMikeLee & I called for an oversight hearing to examine whether the U.S. Olympic Committee tolerated or ignored the sexual abuse of vulnerable young athletes. Today, we will be looking for solutions & accountability. Watch LIVE now -->
