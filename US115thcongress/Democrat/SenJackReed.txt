He spoke his mind in the face of powerful forces. Today we lost one of the most courageous men & ardent patriots in American history. We’ll miss John every day. My heart is with his family & a nation grateful for his life & service. …  … A bipartisan bill to help protect our elections is being blocked by Trump.

The Trump-DeVos #gunsforteachers plan is a bad idea that would cheat kids out of educational resources & make them less safe.

Americans who work hard & pay into Social Security deserve to retire with dignity. I will continue working to strengthen Social Security & protect it from being used as a piggybank to pay for #Trumptax. It is unacceptable for Pres Trump to try to degrade & dehumanize someone in this manner. These kinds of comments reflect poorly on the President & demean the office of the Presidency itself. The American people deserve better. … MUST READ: Learn how Trump Admin’s efforts to rollback #MLA protections for our troops is “akin to removing your sentries from guard posts on military compounds” & harms our military. … Further proof that the Trump trickle down tax law isn’t for the middle class; corporations pocket billions while workers don’t see an increase in their paychecks. This isn’t right or sustainable. … Voting is a right & a responsibility. Regardless of who you vote for, I urge all eligible RIers to register to vote & will always work hard to ensure the integrity of our elections & that every vote counts. Register today:  Today, Pres Trump is signing the #FY19NDAA into law & touting its many benefits for our servicemen & women. But at the same time, his Admin is rolling back #MLA protections for our troops & #milfams & making them more vulnerable to predatory financial practices. Shameful. Getting set to meet w/ @SenWhitehouse & @RISecState to talk #electionsecurity. Also want to remind everyone that today (8/13) is the deadline to register to vote:.

Despite stark warnings from U.S. intelligence, State Attorneys General, & social media companies, Republicans today blocked needed #ElectionSecurity aid to states. Congress must continue working to provide states w/ resources to harden their voting systems … Pres Trump sought to cut $20 billion from critical transportation & housing priorities that benefit working families.

Thank You @SenJackReed for hearing our storypic.twitter.com/sHma52niRz We need an economy that works for everyone. Corporate gains may be up, but more people’s paychecks are lagging. In order to achieve real economic progress workers must benefit too. Top-heavy #TrumpTax prioritizes wealthiest few at expense of everyone else. … President Trump’s attempt to walk back his disastrous statements at the Trump-Putin press conference today is too little, too late and simply not credible a full day later. If President Trump accepts U.S. intelligence then why did he side with Putin on multiple occasions while they were standing shoulder to shoulder?  And why does he continue trying to equivocate now? President Trump’s incoherent and shifting stance suggests he is either insincere or he committed an act of diplomatic ineptitude. President Trump is adamant there was ‘no collusion,’ yet equally adamant about avoiding the Special Counsel.    President Trump sat down with Vladimir Putin yesterday, now he should sit down with Bob Mueller. I’m pleased that @federalreserve Chairman Jerome Powell publicly & explicitly disagreed with Pres Trump’s assessment that the European Union is our “foe.” The #EU is certainly not our foe. Pres Trump’s statement was uninformed & wrong.pic.twitter.com/PcRuSgtoAT At times today, President Trump sounded more like Putin’s press agent than the President of the United States. Some of his comments could have come straight from a Russian disinformation operation. My full statement: … Today, President Trump blamed the U.S., praised Putin, and did a real disservice to America. Such a shocking, dangerous, and weak break from the actions of past Presidents of both parties. Putin is not our friendly 'competitor.' He’s an adversary who hacked our democracy. Joining MSNBC’s @amjoyshow at 10:30am to discuss the independent investigation into the Trump-Russia probe & Pres Trump’s ill-advised decision to go forward w/ a private meeting at the upcoming Trump-Putin summit. Latest indictment from Trump-Russia probe shows Putin expended considerable resources to interfere in U.S. election to benefit the Trump campaign. If there is a 1-on-1 Trump-Putin meeting, Pres Trump seems incapable of seriously confronting Putin for misdeeds that benefited him. Sent joint letter urging Pres Trump to avoid meeting Putin alone. Keeping American staff & voices out of room gives Putin an advantage, could lead to Pres Trump making more unforced errors/concessions to Russia, & means no verifiable record of discussion. … President Trump should immediately cancel his meeting with Vladimir Putin.  This was a direct attack by a foreign adversary, in communication with Americans, to interfere in our election.   Public #libraries are such important community spaces & civic resources.

Tonight @SenJackReed joins @TheLastWord 10pm. Getting set to join @AriMelber on @thebeatwithari to discuss the importance of NATO to U.S. security & the need to stand with our loyal allies in defense of our shared values. As Trump arrives in Brussels for NATO summit, the Senate just passed, 97-2, a motion to "reaffirm the ironclad US commitment under Article 5 to the collective defense of the alliance," as @SenJackReed put it earlier today US Senate voted 97-2 today in favor of a non-binding motion by @SenJackReed to reaffirm the country's commitment to NATO - response to President Trump's comments ahead of NATO and Putin summits. Another act of Trump Admin sabotage against health care & the #ACA. Pres Trump is suppressing enrollment & driving up prices, but he will NOT succeed in killing a law that continues to help millions of Americans each & every day. … In advance of the #NATO summit in Brussels & the Trump-Putin summit (which should be staffed) in Helsinki, the U.S. must send a strong message to our allies & adversaries that we are unwavering in support of NATO & a Europe free from the threat of external aggression. Clean energy means jobs says @SenJackReed. He’s co chair of the #bipartisan Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus. Congress has supported a strong #budget for @ENERGY’s clean energy activities.pic.twitter.com/x0HITgYLyb Pres Trump chose an overtly partisan nominee & once again rejected a chance at finding consensus.

The President can either believe Russia or he can believe our country’s intel chiefs, generals, cabinet secretaries, and diplomats who’ve all said the same thing: Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and they’ll be back in 2018. … The President can either believe his Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, or he can believe Vladimir Putin. … The President can either believe his FBI Director Chris Wray, or he can believe Vladimir Putin. … The President can either believe his NSA Director and head of US Cyber Command General Nakasone, or he can believe Vladimir Putin. … The President can either believe his Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, or he can believe Vladimir Putin. … Pres Trump keeps choosing Putin’s word over the US intelligence community’s & giving Kremlin a green light to undermine U.S. democracy & elections. It needs to stop. But will continue as long as GOP majority in Congress goes along.

Everyone should have the right to a safe workplace, fair wages, decent benefits, & the ability to organize & have their voices heard. Unions uplift living standards for everyone.

Today it’s Muslims, tomorrow it could be your religion. My statement: … Americans shouldn’t have to pay an age tax, but the Trump Admin’s policies are forcing Americans age 50 to 64 to start paying higher health premiums & weakening protections for all people w/ preexisting conditions. #ProtectOurCare … Three years ago today, the Supreme Court upheld the #ACA as #Constitutional. We must fight efforts to sabotage people's #healthcare & continue working to ensure more Americans can purchase affordable health insurance & improve the way health care is delivered. #ProtectOurCare Breaking ground on new @GDElectricBoat #submarine manufacturing facilities at @QuonsetRI.

This marks the 57th consecutive year that the Senate has come together on a bipartisan basis to advance a defense policy bill. New federal contract of up to $20M awarded to @UnderseaTech by @NUWCNewport is good news for RI. Will bring together leading academic, commercial, & defense organizations to accelerate undersea research & advance maritime technology.pic.twitter.com/qtJ9iixzOE Kudos to former First Lady @laurawbush for speaking out against Trump Admin’s choice to implement “cruel” & “immoral” #familyseparation policy.

We're proud of you & I'm pleased to have helped secure federal funding to support training & hiring.pic.twitter.com/EJSYjILlag Family separation is NOT the law – It’s a policy shift undertaken at behest of Pres Trump and AG Sessions. Unacceptable for Trump Admin to repeatedly claim otherwise. … A fitting tribute for someone who continues inspiring future generations about what it means to be a leader. … I support diplomatic engagement over twitter insults. But Pres Trump’s lack of preparedness at North Korea summit cost the U.S. He needs to do better, or he will keep handing victories to NK & do a real disservice to the security of America & our allies. … Today is #FlagDay, an opportunity to honor The #StarsandStripes & reflect on what #OldGlory symbolizes, including: equality, freedom, goodness, hope, independence, justice, liberty, unity, & the continuing struggle for a more perfect Union.

Gillette Stadium would be a great venue & this will be a terrific opportunity to bring more international visitors to RI!  … The Kim-Trump summit was more of a photo-op than the kind of substantive, diplomatic agreement this situation requires. My full statement: … The Trump Admin’s policy of systematically separating #immigrant families is costly, ineffective, & deliberately cruel. Joined @dii_of_ri & @SenWhitehouse in calling for passage of The Keep Families Together Act & bipartisan #immigration reform. #KeepFamiliesTogetherpic.twitter.com/iGRo2PBoa8 Today, the Trump Admin’s repeal of #NetNeutrality goes into effect, but the fight for internet freedom continues.

Investing in suicide prevention programs can help save lives. #suicideawareness #bethe10 … In their quest to undermine the ACA, the Trump Admin is now trying to throw out protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Unconscionable. American people deserve better. … On June 9, 1772, RIers set HMS #Gaspee ablaze & sparked a revolution. Ever since, RI’s independent spirit has burned brightly. Kudos to @GaspeeDay Committee for keeping the flames of history & torch of liberty burning brightly! #GaspeeDays   Pleased we got unanimous support to advance #THUDApprops bill out of full committee. Bipartisan bill includes significant transportation & housing investments to benefit RI & communities nationwide. … 300 intrepid @CurtisCornerMS students stopped by the @uscapitol today as part of #CCMSinDC2018. They tried taking a nice group photo on the Capitol steps, but got photobombed by @SenWhitehouse @JimLangevin @RepCicilline & some other guy.pic.twitter.com/vGzJtSXAIr Looks like #TrumpTax bill works as intended: Corporate windfalls, exploding U.S. debt, & depleting #SocialSecurity & #Medicare trust funds. Any short-term benefits of #GOPTaxScam may come from your retirement. … Modernizing public schools helps boost student achievement & our economy. But school infrastructure was NOT part of Trump’s infrastructure proposal, & the Trump Admin proposes ZERO funding for upgrading school infrastructure in their budget. … Today, we remember the heroism & extraordinary courage of brave Americans & Allied forces who stormed the beaches, defeated tyranny, & turned the tide of history. We must continually strive to be worthy of their great sacrifice. #DDay74pic.twitter.com/xk0sRk0QCW Congress must get to work to improve health outcomes for patients & help lower costs for consumers. Today, I joined w/ @SenateDems in calling for bipartisan action & outlining a plan to force #healthcare votes this summer. #ABetterDeal #ProtectOurCare  We did it!

Thx to all the kids, parents, & grandparents who really put the "star" in STAR Act & helped us achieve this victory for families!pic.twitter.com/OtzR5rm1FV Pres Trump’s misguided health policies are forcing Americans to pay more for less health coverage because he's undermining insurance markets.

Chairman @SenJohnMcCain’s devotion to duty & sheer determination are inspiring. He has always taken on challenges with a sense of urgency & fearlessness & his many contributions to this #FY19NDAA are no exception. I am grateful for his service & enduring friendship. #NDAA The #FY19NDAA strengthens our military, wisely prioritizes resources & provides our troops with a well-deserved pay raise. Although Chairman @SenJohnMcCain wasn’t in DC for markup, his stamp is firmly on this bill, & I salute him & @JimInhofe for their steadfast leadership. #NDAA SASC voted 25-2 to approve the John S. McCain III National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019. Bill supports a total of $716B for national defense programs, including a base budget of $639B & $69 billion for OCO. #NDAA  … Thank you @SenJackReed!

Congress can take needed, bipartisan steps to help reduce #gunviolence, if lawmakers can summon the courage. RI stands w/ #SanteFe. Good news for consumers & #freespeech: US Senate just voted 52-47 to pass a CRA overturning the Trump Admin’s repeal of #NetNeutrality rules. This is a key step toward preserving a fair & open Internet. Now we must keep pressure on the House to vote & help #SaveTheInternet! Senate now voting on motion to proceed on #NetNeutrality CRA. The big vote on the CRA itself will come around 3 pm. So there is still time to make your voice heard & tell Senators to protect fair, open, & free Internet access for all Americans.

He & his family deserve respect. … Prescription drug prices are soaring under Pres Trump. He refuses to drive a hard bargain w/ drug companies, instead giving them corporate tax breaks & sticking taxpayers w/ the bill. Americans deserve better & Dems have a plan to lower Rx drug prices:   … Here's @SenJackReed questioning Gina Haspel … No Senator can consider Gina Haspel’s nomination to be CIA Director in good conscience without first reviewing the Durham report – regarding the destruction of videotapes by the CIA. #UnlockDurhamReportpic.twitter.com/3RBHT6oxNh Today, we filed our petition to force a floor vote next week to restore #NetNeutrality. Spread the word & help us stop giant telecoms from erecting new toll lanes on the internet. #OneMoreVote … Pres Trump isn’t being tough on Iran, he's letting Iran off the hook.

Throughout her impressive legal career, Ms. McElroy has demonstrated the highest levels of integrity, professionalism, & skill.

Neither POTUS nor the Pentagon may take money from our troops & spend it on an ineffective #borderwall. … .@SenJackReed and I wrote to Defense Secretary Mattis about the President's suggestion to use the military's budget to pay for his border wall. We believe DOD has no legal authority to do that, and it would also cut funding for the troops.  … Chag sameach, happy Easter, and a peaceful and joyful weekend to all! While a delay is helpful, it's disappointing that Pres. Trump is terminating DED for honest, hardworking #Liberian refugees. I call on Congress to end this uncertainty for Liberians by taking up and passing the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act. … Delicious recipes & fresh, local seafood at the kickoff of #QuahogWeek!
