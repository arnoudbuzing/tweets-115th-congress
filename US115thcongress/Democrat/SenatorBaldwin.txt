That is why I will continue my work to protect it.   #ProtectOurCare I was branded as a child with the words, ‘pre-existing condition,’ so I am going to continue fighting to make sure that no family has to choose between helping their child get better or going bankrupt. President Trump is threatening guaranteed and affordable health care coverage for the more than 133 million Americans – and over 2 million Wisconsinites – with pre-existing conditions. The Trump Administration slashed funding to states for outreach efforts that help more people sign up for health care. This will mean fewer people in rural #WI will receive the support they need to obtain affordable coverage. President Trump’s sabotage of the health care market has created severe instability and already contributed to premium spikes in Wisconsin this year. Ever since then, @POTUS has been trying to do what Congressional Republicans couldn’t: Sabotage our health system by undermining guaranteed health protections and access to affordable care. That’s not right. This week marks the one year anniversary of our vote in the Senate against Republican health care repeal legislation. I voted against repeal because Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take away people's health care. I’m headed to the Senate floor to speak out against the Trump Administration’s repeated attempts to sabotage our health care system. We must #ProtectOurCare. Watch here:  ….

We should #RewardWork, not just wealth. So far this year, corporations have announced more than $480 billion in stock buybacks, overwhelmingly benefiting top executives and wealthy shareholders, and leaving middle class workers behind. I’m calling on SEC Chairman Clayton to open a public comment period to review the SEC’s current rules around stock buybacks, which haven’t been updated in over a decade.pic.twitter.com/2k0cQQ0yAc My statement in response to the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.pic.twitter.com/U2oWDvmy7U I’m working to pass the bipartisan Senate #FarmBill18 because we need to make sure Washington is working for Wisconsin farmers. … “The Republican tax reform package that was supposed to raise wages and spur hiring has instead funded a record stock buyback and dividend spree, benefiting investors and company executives over workers.” … #GOPTaxScam News: “Companies used Trump's tax cut for record stock buybacks, not wages” via @nbcnews … Corporate special interests already have too much power in Washington and today #SCOTUS gave them more to make a rigged system worse for working families and a shrinking middle class. We now need a legislative fix for workers that builds our middle class. #Janus I listened to students, businesses & manufacturers in Wisconsin and worked across party lines to respond to our workforce readiness needs by moving bipartisan career & technical education legislation forward. #CTEworks  … .@oshkoshcorp is a key driver of our #MadeInWI manufacturing economy and supports good paying jobs in Wisconsin.

Thread  … I’m working to support businesses that are advancing #MadeinWI science, research and innovation. … I am pushing @POTUS to keep his promise to Wisconsin workers and manufacturers on #BuyAmerica. They need a permanent commitment in the final #WRDA bill and he should expect nothing less from @SenateMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan. … The #SCOTUS decision doesn't make the #TravelBan right. In fact it's wrong. America has been, and should be, better than this. I support better trade deals, not trade wars. Tariffs against our trading partners in Europe do not fix our trade problems, and President Trump's haphazard approach on tariffs with our allies will hurt Wisconsin’s manufacturing and agriculture economy. … I’m proud to introduce legislation to expand resources for our dairy businesses to foster innovation, so Wisconsin farmers, cheesemakers and dairy processors can continue moving #AmericasDairyland forward. … More sabotage from the Trump Admin. They have failed to announce funding to support health insurance navigators, who are critical to helping families find quality, affordable health coverage.

Today, Wisconsin is eligible for $11.8 million in new federal funding for local prevention, treatment & recovery efforts.  … More health care sabotage from the Trump Administration. These plans undermine the guaranteed health care protections in the ACA and could make it harder for people with pre-existing conditions to find quality, affordable health coverage. #ProtectOurCare … Today we observe #Juneteenth Independence Day. Although we have made tremendous progress, the march for full equality must continue. Today let us join together as one community, inspired by those who came before us, and recommit ourselves to move America #Forward. We cannot allow children to be used as political pawns by the Trump Administration. I cosponsored the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act to end this Trump policy. Every Democrat in the Senate supports it. If Republicans oppose children being taken from their parents, they should too. Tearing families apart and traumatizing children is wrong and immoral. There is no law requiring the separation of families and this inhumane Trump Administration policy could and should end today. … I’ve met with farmers across Wisconsin, heard the challenges they face & know what support they need. I’m bringing those concerns to the Senate to make sure Washington is working for Wisconsin farmers with the Senate #FarmBill … Heavy rains caused flooding and flash floods in Northern Wisconsin.

I’m disappointed #SCOTUS punted on hyper partisan #gerrymandering. Health experts agree. Allowing insurance companies to sell junk plans could lead to weaker coverage & higher premiums, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. I’m calling on the Trump Admin to stop this policy & protect people with pre-existing conditions.pic.twitter.com/It1CqPjkkM During #ImmigrantHeritageMonth let us remember that we are a nation of immigrants because America has always been a land of opportunity.

My #FairCareAct takes on #JunkPlans. … Expanding the sale and marketing of #JunkPlans could exclude basic benefits including hospitalization, prescription drugs, mental health services, substance abuse treatment and maternity care.  … If the Trump Admin allows insurance companies to once again sell #JunkPlans, premiums will rise for older Americans and millions of people living with pre-existing conditions will have their guaranteed protections threatened and face higher costs. … I'm heartbroken again.  Another tragic school shooting with more lives lost. Congress has a responsibility to address gun violence like the public health crisis that it is.
