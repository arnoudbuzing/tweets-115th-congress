I call upon Brett Kavanaugh for the good of the country and the integrity of the court to step aside immediately. The additional information provided by Ms. Ramirez regarding Kavanaugh’s behavior in college presents a pattern of conduct that makes it absolutely clear that he is entirely unsuited to serve on the Supreme Court. If Dr. Ford has the courage to come before the committee, the committee should have the decency to hold a REAL hearing, with relevant witnesses, and to treat her with dignity and respect. NO BULLYING and no sham hearing! .@realDonaldTrump: quit cooking up new ways to traumatize children!  Children belong in homes, schools and parks.  Not behind barbed wire. … Great championship game.

It’s sick and it’s sad how some elected officials and members of the media are blaming and shaming Dr. Ford for coming forward with her story about Kavanaugh. Women who speak out about trauma deserve our respect. Not our disdain.

Right now, the reported enforcement deal in this agreement is insufficient. Reportedly, this potential deal does include some positive steps, such as a more level playing field for auto manufacturing and an overdue reining-in of unaccountable corporate tribunals.

For more than two decades, American jobs and American workers have suffered because of major imbalances in NAFTA. On #WomensEqualityDay we honor the 98th anniversary of a women’s right to vote & commit to continue defending a woman’s access to safe & legal abortion & birth control. This is a fight that continues & it’s why Kavanagh’s position on women’s rights make him unsuitable for SCOTUS. I am deeply saddened to learn of John McCain’s passing. He led a courageous & remarkable life, made tremendous sacrifices, & carried a deep love for our nation. He was a true American hero & it was an honor to serve w/ him in the Senate. My thoughts & prayers are with his family. You know who else believes that “flipping almost ought to be illegal”? Organized crime bosses. … Double damage: Trump and the GOP are making the problem even worse by proposing a bill that allows insurance companies to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions.  Better idea: LEAVE IT ALONE! … That’s why you don’t celebrate a victory before you put in the work.

Legitimate businesses acting in compliance with state cannabis laws should have access to the American banking system—it’s good for public safety and local economies. This story is absurd & yet another reason why Congress should pass the SAFE Banking Act.  … … Democracy is on trial. All Senators must step into the breach to protect justice. No one is above the law. As of yesterday, the President is now the equivalent of an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal act. Kavanaugh must not be considered until the Mueller investigation is complete. To do otherwise would taint the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. Don’t know whether to laugh or cry? Here’s a third option: fight back & make your voice heard in the Senate. We MUST #StopKavanaugh! … Further evidence of Russia’s continued efforts to attack our Democracy. This threat is real and must be taken seriously. … The cloud of corruption hanging over @realDonaldTrump and the Trump organization is a serious matter. 8 guilty pleas for Michael Cohen. 8 guilty convictions for Paul Manafort. THIS is why the Muller investigation must continue. If we don’t take action against climate chaos NOW, US economic growth will be a third lower than what it could have been. #TodaysClimateFact … Today, the Trump agenda to turn the EPA into the Polluter Protection Agency is complete. … Health care premiums are already rising due to GOP sabotage efforts.

We CANNOT let this happen! This is a dark hour in the history of our nation. For generations, America has stood as the beacon of hope to the rest of the world. Don’t let the "Divider in Chief" win. This is very serious and very real. We MUST #StopKavanaugh. Kavanaugh wants to overturn Roe v. Wade and take away women’s constitutional rights. We can’t let this happen. Fight back. … Selectively revoking security clearances from those who disagree with is you is a massive abuse of presidential power. Just another action of a tyrant – not a president. … The freedom of the press is a fundamental cornerstone of our democracy.

Making equivocating statements on bigotry is not leadership. The Trump administration’s rollbacks on environmental protections benefit big business at the expense of our planet. With 46 rules overturned and 30 in the process, it’s important to understand what’s at risk. #TodaysClimateFact … Not so fast! The Senate must not move forward with Brett Kavanagh’s confirmation hearing until we see all of his records from his time in the Bush Administration. No documents, no hearing. … So tragic.

This court filing says loud and clear that the Trump Admin has no interest in fixing the abomination they created. … Thank you to the brave firefighters protecting our communities. My thoughts are with all of the Oregonians who are suffering through scary evacuations and terrible smoke. … Pure evil. Snatching children at the border from parents legally entering our country to seek asylum was pure evil. It is a dark stain on our nation’s history, and it should never have happened. We MUST keep fighting until EVERY child is reunited with their family. This is how a dictator handles the press and news they don’t like. This is a dangerous road we are on right now. History will remember. … America: YOU have the power to #StopKavanaugh. Senators are back in their states for the next 10 days. Make sure they know how you feel. Do NOT stop. YOU have the power to stop this nomination. We are not a dictatorship. We are not a monarchy. We are a democratic republic, and the press is NOT the enemy of the people. … Support of the UN led peace process is the only way to end the civil war in Yemen, which has raged for 4 years.

I’m thankful to all the people standing up and speaking out. TOGETHER, we can take back our country. .@realDonaldTrump definitely kept *a* promise.

But yet again, he PROVES who he is really fighting for: the ultra-rich and the elite. When is enough, enough? … Donald Trump raised your taxes to (1) help giant corporations give huge pay raises to their wealthy CEOs, and (2) cut those CEOs’ taxes.

Or are we a nation that inflicts trauma on children of families fleeing persecution? I know my answer. Ripping children from their parents is child abuse. Cruelty as a means of deterrence is wrong. Inflicting trauma on victims fleeing violence, and denying them the right to petition for asylum, is an evil deed. All of us have listened to the tape of a 6-year-old Alisson Madrid pleading with border agents for the chance to call her aunt to pick her up after being ripped away from her parents at the border while other children can be heard screaming and wailing in the background. … Trump Administration, repeat after me: Office buildings are not shelters.

This answer by President Trump will be seen by Russia as a sign of weakness and create far more problems than it solves. (1/3) A year ago Trump wanted Russia to “help” with our cyber security. Now he wants our ace investigators to be guided by Russian intelligence officers.   Is Trump: A.)   Naïve; B.)   Befuddled; or C.)   Manchurian? … I never thought I would see the day when our American President would stand on the stage with the Russian President and place blame on the United States for Russian aggression. This is shameful. A better thing, Mr. President, would be to declare: "Russia is the enemy of America and our allies, and we will expose and respond to their continued cyber-attacks against our nation." … The last ‘interesting idea’ from Putin that Trump liked was having Russia ‘help’ with our cybersecurity. Perhaps the single worst national security idea ever suggested by a US President. … Not thanks to the attack on our democracy?  Or the first invasion of a sovereign country in Europe since WWII? Or the slaughter of innocent civilians in Syria?  Or the use of banned chemical weapons on Russian exiles in the UK? Or the murder of journalists?  Or or or.... … Many experts say that the college-debt bubble will cause the next great American recession. We MUST fix this problem now. Our children deserve  better. … A college education has long been a ticket to the middle-class. But for many Americans, that dream has become out of reach. Our children deserve a college education that won’t cripple them with debt when they graduate.pic.twitter.com/Go9nT4EK1a Trump blamed others today for “why there is so much hatred and dissension in our country—but at some point it will heal.”  He’s right; it will heal and the moment will be when he is no longer in office sowing hate as the “Divider in Chief!” … Have no doubt. Kavanaugh WILL vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. #StopKavanaugh … Thank you @SenBlumenthal and @SenJeffMerkley for your outspoken opposition of Kavanaugh - we have to #SaveSCOTUS This wasn’t a joke then, and it isn’t a joke now. This was a full-out assault on our democracy. … Donald Trump must call off the Putin Summit. We need a watchdog for America, not a lapdog for Putin. These new charges are stunning:  12 Russian intel officers charged.  Added to the tally of:  Charges: 4 ex-Trump Advisers, 1 lawyer, 1 digital marketing strategist, 14 Russian nationals, 3 Russian companies.  Guilty Pleas: 5  This is not a Witch Hunt. … Tomorrow is the 3 yr. birthday of the Iran deal, which @realDonaldTrump unwisely violated in May.

Millions of lives may depend on US aid. … One thing is clear: Child cruelty as a deterrence was wrong on June 3rd when I went down to the border, and it’s still wrong now. We don’t hurt children. We must reunite these families immediately. … You’re right @maddow: there’s a lot to Kavanaugh’s record. He’s argued that a sitting POTUS should be immune from prosecution & investigations. His vision is more suited for a kingdom & a king, then for a democratic republic and a POTUS. In America nobody should be above the law.pic.twitter.com/miXiPHKXWG Be bold.

Good start! 1/2: Calls in my office about Brett Kavanaugh were running 13:1 against his nomination.  Keep it up, America!  To win this fight, there needs to be a popular revolt against taking health care away from sick people... .@realDonaldTrump and his 2016 campaign are currently under investigation. Trump FIRED Comey to relieve "great pressure because of Russia." NOW he picks Kavanaugh who argued that sitting presidents should be immune from prosecution and investigations. This is NOT a coincidence.pic.twitter.com/mc1r5uMC59 In Oregon alone, more than 1.5 billion dollars has been spent fighting wildfires since 2000.

Deeply disturbing decision to put two Reuters journalists on trial on trumped-up charges. Their only crime: exposing horrific ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya at hands of Burma’s military. I call upon Gov of Burma to release both journalists w/out delay. … Thank you for your leadership @SenJeffMerkley. You are a champion always fighting for women and for the soul of our democracy. … Brett Kavanaugh could give @realDonaldTrump the power to pardon himself. This is unacceptable. Make sure your Senator knows that you oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. #WhatsAtStakepic.twitter.com/WSMShLLXpT .@realDonaldTrump is terrified of Robert Mueller. It’s no wonder he chose Kavanaugh as his #SCOTUSPick. He’s someone who argued that Sitting Presidents should be immune from prosecution and not be indicted & POTUS has the sole power to appoint and fire special prosecutors at will Brett Kavanaugh wanted to keep a young undocumented woman jailed when the rest of his Circuit Court ordered her released to terminate her pregnancy. He’s a sure fire bet to gut #RoeVsWade and criminalize abortion. #SCOTUSNomination #scotuspick minorities, workers, and consumers to participate fully and freely in society. To safeguard the rights of all Americans and our founding vision of a ‘We the People’ nation, Americans must rise up and make their voices heard in the U.S. Senate. The justices of the Supreme Court should be selected based on the wisdom, experience, and values they bring to the job, not hand-picked by ideological organizations committed to rolling back the ability of women... These are no longer wild hypotheticals; these are real and imminent threats to our nation. Racial inequality and blatant voter suppression could be further embraced by the highest court in the land. Roe v. Wade could be overturned and abortion and forms of contraception criminalized. Americans with pre-existing conditions could lose life-saving health care. Marriage equality could be overturned. We knew that if Donald Trump picked anyone off his list of extremists, fundamental rights would be at stake. Now, the decision has arrived, and everything we feared is on the line. Here is #WhatsAtStake, and these are no longer wild hypotheticals; these are REAL and IMMINENT threats to our nation. Americans must rise up and make sure their Senators know that they oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.pic.twitter.com/gaNO87Xigj Donald Trump has pledged to appoint an extremist far-right Supreme Court Justice who would overturn Roe v.

It is our duty as Americans to stand up, speak out, march in the streets, and take our country back. … Can we please restore an EPA that fights for clean air and clean water. That's their mission and what we need. Way past time.

Organize. Run for office. Stand up and make your voices heard. Don’t stop fighting. Let’s build a better world. Why is the open Supreme Court seat important? Because packing the court with far-right extremists could enshrine the political corruption of Citizens United for decades to come. #SaveSCOTUS Janelle Bynum is a great Representative. This tragic incident is a reminder of just how far we still have to go to become a more tolerant society.   … Today, we celebrate our independence, our freedom, and our country.

The ORR has just denied my request for @RonWyden, @RepBonamici, and myself to visit the refugee children detained at Morrison Shelter in Oregon.  The request was made with over a week's notice. The #GOPTaxScam was nothing more than a big payday for the wealthy, elite, and big corporations...

Helping ZTE. Fighting to put Russia back in the G8. Attacking our allies.  Sure would be nice to have an American President who’s working for America, not for Russia and China. .@realDonaldTrump, your policy of snatching children from their parents is traumatic to families and having dire consequences. This is just tragic. … A general weighs in: Climate chaos is fueling migration crises and putting immense strain on our military around the world. This is a matter of national security. #TodaysClimateFact … Deeply grateful to Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley for his passion for helping animals. Thank you for meeting with Anya, Leeni, and Rizzo to discuss the KITTEN Act! … Innocent children don’t belong in federal prisons, torn from their families. @JeffMerkley is right. Congress should follow Senator Merkley’s lead and take action now. … Being diplomatic should be, well, a core trait of U.S. diplomats who represent our country overseas. Unfortunately, that appears to be lost on @RealDonaldTrump. Didn’t want to be right about the potential damage that Grenell’s bad judgment could cause in Germany… but sadly, less than one month into his tenure, he’s already jeopardizing our relationship with this critical ally. … Ok, really: what does Putin have on @realDonaldTrump? Russia has attacked our election, invaded Ukraine, slaughtered innocent Syrians, and yet Trump does Russia’s bidding while alienating our allies who stand with us. Which country is the American President working for? … Thank you, @kittenxlady – and kittens! – for coming by today. Let’s pass the KITTEN Act and protect innocent animals like these three kittens from being euthanized in @USDA testing.pic.twitter.com/YUuPyDTQkO $200 BILLION in stock buybacks in ONE MONTH.

Ryan Bounds doesn't fit that bill. #ProtectOurCourts #OutofBoundspic.twitter.com/64C7U5SJfr Polar bears aren’t the only bears that are suffering from climate change.

I wish him all the best in this battle. This is disgraceful.

The inhumane & cruel policy that's separating families at the southern border is in fact a direct result of this admin's relentless attacks on immigrant families. Only President Trump can end it. #FamiliesBelongTogether … Met Alex Loznak at my recent Douglas County town hall in Elkton. As a plaintiff in @youthvgov, he’s fighting to take on climate chaos for the next generation. #TodaysClimateFact … Glad the Attorney General is willing to talk.

Scientists have launched an investigation to learn more about how quickly she will melt. Fully melted, Thwaites would raise the world's oceans by 10 feet. #TodaysClimateFact … No, @realDonaldTrump, that’s a lie. Your Administration’s child-snatching “Zero Tolerance” policy is a ZERO HUMANITY policy, inflicting pain and trauma on children. It is morally bankrupt and absolutely destructive to traumatize children as a strategy to influence their parents. … Unacceptable and inhumane. All Americans should know the cruelty that is being enacted in their name. … .@allinwithchris @chrislhayes was one of the first to break the story about this cruel new child separation policy.

Today’s #SCOTUS ruling only underscores the importance of making full equality the law of the land nationwide. We need to pass the #EqualityAct and move #EqualityForward. MUST WATCH: @SenJeffMerkley went to Brownsville, TX last night to visit immigrant children ripped from their families. He was denied entry and asked to leave the property. #FamiliesBelongTogether #KeepFamiliesTogether #wherearethechildrenpic.twitter.com/DRW0E8qQxs Yesterday, @SenJeffMerkley was barred from seeing the inside of a detention center in Texas. This is just the latest example of how Trump is advancing an immigration enforcement agenda that is unaccountable, un-American & increasingly unlawful.  pic.twitter.com/2yquNAoTL9 Family separation is un-American, and the lack of transparency surrounding these detention centers is indefensible.   The American people have a right to know what's happening to these children. We can't stand for this, it's not who we should be. #FamiliesBelongTogether … This is outrageous. Sec. Nielsen owes us answers. My team was also barred from touring a migrant processing facility where families are being separated.    When the elected representatives of the people can't observe how our government is operating, we're in an upside down world. … In South Florida, rising sea levels are so alarming that three newspapers are banding together for an urgent call to action. Current @NOAA models predict that flooding will only get worse in the next few decades. #TodaysClimateFact … Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley was denied entry to an immigrant detention center.  The federal government does "not want members of Congress or the public to know what's going on" in the center, which allegedly holds 1000 kids separated from their parents, he says.pic.twitter.com/RUOzwkbkUS Grateful that @SenJeffMerkley is where he is right now, fighting for children and families and our humanity. … This administration be must be held accountable for its heartless and cruel policies of separating children from their families.

What’s going on in these private detention centers that even a US Senator is barred from entering? … Mr. President, the only “horrible law” is YOUR policy. YOU have the power to change it. If you saw what I saw today, you would.   Never before has America deliberately inflicted cruelty on children to deter asylum seekers from finding refuge here. Never. And we never should. … Thank you, @SenJeffMerkley. Separating children from their parents betrays our deeply held American values and does nothing to make our nation safer or stronger. #FamiliesBelongTogether … US senator can’t gain access … I was barred entry. Asked repeatedly to speak to a supervisor—he finally came out and said he can’t tell us anything. Police were called on us.

A world heat record for April – 122 degrees in Pakistan! – is in sync with climate chaos driving more common and intense heatwaves. #TodaysClimateFact … The Burmese military has perpetrated horrific crimes against the #Rohingya people, and those who are responsible for these atrocities must be held accountable by the international community. Thank you to these brave survivors for coming forward. … This excellent @nytimes feature shows the huge, impending challenge facing #Rohingya refugee camps that could be swept away in monsoon season. The whole world must come together to support aid groups that are working to build fortifications. … For perspective, that's 96 parts per million higher than when I was born, a 31% increase! This enormous change is driving climate chaos and we must stop it. Atmospheric concentration of CO2 reached an unprecedented high last month: 410 parts per million. The numbers don't lie—humans are causing dramatic changes to the earth’s atmosphere. #TodaysClimateFact … As NV's AG, I saw firsthand what happened when the #BigBanks engaged in risky behavior & predatory lending practices because of lack of oversight & regulation. The road that allows banks to police themselves again is a dangerous one we shouldn't go down. … The attack on Wall Street reforms continue: The feds just gave big banks permission to take bigger risks and gamble with our money by softening the Volcker rule. … The Volcker Rule prevents Wall St banks from gambling with taxpayer-backed money. Gutting it would be a huge gift to the big banks, their well-paid lobbyists and substantially increase the risk that working people will have to bail out the banks again. … Wall Street profits are up while workers’ wages remain flat. It is outrageous that the Fed is letting the biggest banks gamble with your money yet again and turn our economy into a casino once more. … The Volcker Rule was created to stop big banks that enjoy massive taxpayer support from recklessly gambling. The Trump Administration wants to gut it: … Let’s call it like it is: This is a massive giveaway to the biggest banks. Small, local banks don’t want to run hedge funds with their customers’ money. This is a brazen attempt by big bank CEOs & Trump-appointed allies to reopen the Wall Street casino. … "Every senator should hold town halls!"    … @SenJeffMerkley stands with regional #healthcare providers as he introduces the Choose Medicare Act.

What happened to fighting for the forgotten man, @realDonaldTrump? Horrifying and completely unacceptable. Thousands of American lives were lost – and the White House and federal officials simply turned a blind eye. We need to act to make sure this never happens in America again. … These expected changes are not designed for small, community banks. They are written to re-open the Wall Street casino and let the biggest banks back into the hedge fund gambling business. A backdoor attempt to re-write Wall Street reform—one that is dangerous and unacceptable. SIREN: Major changes to the Volcker Rule are coming this week, starting tomorrow. This represents the most brazen attack yet on Wall Street reform. High-quality, affordable #healthcare should be easily available to all Americans. The Choose Medicare Act does just that, by making #Medicare available on insurance exchanges and as an employer option.

To members of the armed forces who have worked to defend our freedom, on behalf of all Oregonians: Thank you. This is YOUR cruel policy, @realDonaldTrump. Democrats have already put forward legislation to end it. Stop this madness and quit using children’s lives as pawns in your political games. … .@realdonaldtrump new executive orders are yet another attack on American workers. Instead of undermining civil servants, how about providing government employees the resources they need to serve the American public? … On this one-year anniversary of the horrific attack on Portland’s MAX train, let’s honor the heroes—Rick, Taliesin, and Micah—who stood up to hate, and stand together in goodness. … Trump has broken promise after promise to American workers… but when it comes to saving Chinese workers’ jobs, he’s 100% serious. … Shocked and saddened by the hit-and-run in Portland. My thoughts are with those injured and our entire Portland community. … “Things will only get worse globally, as water demands increase and the effects of climate change begin to be felt.” Day Zero water risk – when home taps have no water – is coming to many places beyond Cape Town. #TodaysClimateFact … Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee set up a committee vote on Ryan  Bounds' 9th Circuit nomination for June 7. Bounds shouldn't have received a hearing over the objections of @SenJeffMerkley and @RonWyden, and he certainly shouldn't receive a vote. We object. #ProtectOurCourtspic.twitter.com/cpeuJCZ38i Couldn't have said it better, @SenJeffMerkley. #NetNeutrality … Five colleges in New England are joining together to create a solar power facility that will allow them to buy electricity at a lower rate than offered on the regional grid.

Well said! … NEW: @SenJeffMerkley releases #AUMF proposal that is tailored to current conflicts, provides for meaningful congressional oversight and public transparency, and includes a three-year expiration date. … Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for providing an alternative that won't lead to #EndlessWar. … "Ignore," distort, or censor. Those are the options the Trump White House is considering to deal with the overwhelming consensus on climate change. Unacceptable and immoral. We need a vision and a plan to #ActOnClimate, not willful ignorance. … During Watergate, principled Republicans stood up and saved our country from a constitutional crisis. We need that again in 2018. If you’re worried about protecting the Mueller investigation, it’s time to make your voice heard in Congress NOW—before it’s too late. The ultimate goal—and the huge danger to our democracy—is for Trump to get Republicans in Congress to help slow or shut down this investigation, and to do so soon, before Mueller can get to the bottom of Trump's own activities. Now, @realDonaldTrump is bullying the Justice Department into making highly sensitive information about an ongoing investigation available to Congressman Nunes, who has a demonstrated intent and history of abusing information to undermine the investigation. Trump and shameless allies like Nunes are trying to paint the Mueller investigation as a frivolous, politically-motivated “witch hunt” with no end. But this is a serious investigation that’s already indicted 19 people and delivered 5 guilty pleas. THREAD: Something very dangerous is happening right now. @realDonaldTrump is trying to make the Mueller investigation into just another partisan political battle, to downplay its significance & keep Americans from uniting against any wrongdoing that might be uncovered. If Congress is serious about reasserting its authority over presidential war-making, it should take up the bill @SenJeffMerkley just introduced -- not Corker-Kaine.  … We face real threats around the world, but I don’t think the American people want an endless, ever-expanding war. We need to take war-making off autopilot and put in place a framework that makes Congress do its job, even if it’s difficult. … Climate chaos is having a major impact in Colorado – shrinking snowpack is hurting agriculture, water supply, and $5 billion ski industry. Now two counties are fighting back to hold fossil fuel companies accountable. #TodaysClimateFact … Congress needs to lead by example in the #MeToo era. I hope all of my colleagues will come together and support this agreement for long-overdue reform of how we handle sexual harassment in our halls. … The front page of the internet agrees… it’s “kind of a big deal” that we're pushing the @FCC to get to the bottom of fake #NetNeutrality comments. @reddit'ers get it - it's not 'We the People' government if public comments are hijacked for bots and special interests, not people.pic.twitter.com/Ef8inFUhie Australia’s federal government said that the nation’s renewable energy targets would be impossible to meet. But now, Australia isn’t just on track to meet them – it’s going to exceed them. #TodaysClimateFact #100by50  … Our youth aren’t just marching in the streets—they’re on the move, from fighting gerrymandering to registering folks to vote. They're laying the groundwork for major change. Politicians who underestimate them do so at their own peril.  … #NeverAgain .@SenJeffMerkley and I have both had our identities stolen to file false comments on the @FCC's website. We wrote to @AjitPaiFCC urging the FCC to employ safeguards designed to weed out comments posted by bots.   Canada has seen an up-tick (pun intended) in the number of its citizens afflicted by Lyme disease. The black-legged carriers of the disease are thriving in the warming climate & expected to expand reach if we don’t rein in CO2 pollution. #TodaysClimateFact … .@SenJeffMerkley & @SenToomey call on @FCC to get to the bottom of identity theft in #NetNeutrality record. Both Senators had their identities stolen & misused in the proceeding--along with 2 million other Americans. This is not right & needs to be fixed.  20 years after the shooting at Thurston High School in Oregon, we’re still reeling from school shootings at Parkland, Santa Fe and so, so many others. We’ve gone far too long without action. We must stop this violence and keep our children safe in schools. … The Northeast’s cap and trade system has cut carbon emissions in half while creating more than 14,500 jobs and $1.4 billion in benefits. When we #ActOnClimate it’s good for our economy too. #TodaysClimateFact … This is a blatant, dangerous attack on @PPFA. Millions of Americans rely on Planned Parenthood as a primary health care provider. This move won’t do anything to decrease abortions, but it will 100% punish those patients who depend on PP for care. … My OpEd this morning in @nytimes:  “The message to millions of Americans lured by the false promises of predatory companies is clear: The Trump administration is not on your side.” … To LGBTQ students at North Bend and in every school across Oregon: I stand with you and I support you. Bullying and harassment in our schools is 100% unacceptable. … Devastating news from Santa Fe High School in Texas. How many more schools must we add to the list after Parkland? How many more children have to die? Students across America have come together to push for a better future & Congress has failed them. We have to do better. #Enough Today marks International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia. Though we’ve made tremendous strides across the globe in recent years, there’s still much work ahead to end anti-#LGBTQ persecution and ensure full equality. Let’s keep pushing! #IDAHOT Dehumanizing minorities isn’t new: -Nazis referred to Jews as rats -Hutus called Tutsis cockroaches in Rwandan genocide -Enslaved African Americans were compared to apes -Radical monks called Rohingya animals   Trump calls immigrants animals.   Words matter – this is dangerous. A thorough review of Gina Haspel’s record makes clear: She was not only involved in the torture program, she was a passionate advocate and defender of the program. That is deeply disturbing and makes her profoundly unfit to run the CIA. Disappointed by the Senate's vote today. Bad allergies this year? The impacts of climate chaos are closer than you may think: Rising temperatures are fueling pollen that arrives earlier and stays around longer. #TodaysClimateFact … You can disagree about immigration policies, but it’s dangerous and unconscionable to call human beings ‘animals’ as @realDonaldTrump did yesterday. This President has a horrific pattern of inflaming hate & dehumanizing minorities. We must all stand up against this bigotry. Yes they do! #SaveTheInternet … We did it!! Today, the Senate voted to save #NetNeutrality. Now, we need the House to vote.  This is critical. Americans don’t want slow and fast lanes. We want good internet service for all, not just the rich and powerful.  We're in the final stretch - let's #SaveTheInternet! Happening now: With the final #NetNeutrality vote rapidly approaching, I’m speaking on the Senate floor urging my colleagues to protect a free and open internet.

Thanks, @SenJeffMerkley for fighting for a real alternative. … The Constitution gives the power to declare war to Congress, not the White House. It’s critical that we repeal and replace the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs – but it would be a huge mistake to give away our constitutional power to the president in the process. … This is it, folks. It’s official: Today, the Senate votes on whether or not to save #NetNeutrality. We need YOUR voices in the final stretch to save the free and open internet!

We need to do everything we can to curb the effects of climate chaos before it’s too late! #TodaysClimateFact … You can't make this stuff up: Trump was happy to give more than a trillion in tax giveaways to big corporations and the richest Americans... but now he's so concerned about the deficit, he wants to cut billions from the Children's Health Insurance Program? … Senate Republican have lost all perspective. A critical point by @SenJeffMerkley:   "For the first 14 circuit court nominations, they waited under Pres. Obama an average of 251 days,  but under Pres. Trump, less than half of 251, 125 days—a breakneck pace."  #ProtectOurCourtspic.twitter.com/pouJKN8CJm Disappointed to see Chairman @ChuckGrassley plans to hold a hearing for a judicial nominee to the 9th Circuit from Oregon without the consent of both home-state Senators. This has never been done before and should not happen now. These are not normal times. .@SenJeffMerkley, @RonWyden react to #IranNuclearDeal withdrawal. "A mistake of enormous proportions."  …pic.twitter.com/AGsc28VCVp What’s Pompeo going to say when Kim asks why he should believe any commitment the U.S. makes? … This is a mistake of enormous proportions for America’s safety and security. The best way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is to not blow up the deal that is verifiably preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. … Farmers across the nation are making healthy soil a priority – good for agriculture and great for the environment! Regenerative farming can help slow climate chaos. #TodaysClimateFact … Sen. @RonWyden and @SenJeffMerkley on 9th Circuit nominee Ryan Bounds receiving a hearing this Wednesday over their objections: “Simply put, this all adds up to one more piece of troubling evidence of the Republicans changing the rules to pack the courts.” #courtsmatterpic.twitter.com/AOMePyJM1Q 1. The best way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is to not blow up the deal that is currently preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. 2. Why would North Korea negotiate with us to give up their nukes if they know we don't keep our word? As I wrote last fall, abandoning the Iran deal puts American safety at risk. The facts today are the same as they were then. … Completely unacceptable. What are we waiting for? … Thank you, @SenFeinstein. Americans need to stand up to this unprecedented, right-wing effort to pack the courts. … New report shows health threats Indiana will face from climate chaos, like more heat waves, worse air quality, longer allergy seasons & more insect-borne diseases. What's coming for Indiana is coming for us all if we don't #ActOnClimate. #TodaysClimateFact … Congrats to Sen. Merkley and his staff on such a great milestone! Thank you for listening to your constituents in every corner of Oregon.  … Thanks to everyone in Harney County who came out to my landmark 350th #townhall!

We had a great discussion on the need to strengthen our economy and improve prosperity for working America.pic.twitter.com/hT3kldoAQW Think 100% #RenewableEnergy isn’t possible? Think again! In March, Portugal produced enough renewable energy to power their entire nation, and then some. #TodaysClimateFact … Congratulations to @PDXFire on the 100th anniversary of their Local 43 union! In 1918, Portland firefighters traveled to D.C. to help start the national #IAFF. Today I was proud to present them with a flag that has flown over the Capital.pic.twitter.com/YSzbvzMv8w Today I joined @RepSchrader @RepBonamici @RonWyden to meet with officials about conditions at Chemawa Indian School in Salem.

Climatic chaos is great for ticks, and terrible for humans. #TodaysClimateFact … Very cool: @EnvDefenseFund is funding a satellite that can help fight climate change by detecting methane leaks “with pinpoint accuracy.” #TodaysClimateFact … Proud my signature is one of them. Now we just need #OneMoreVote to save #NetNeutrality. #SaveTheInternet … Group of Senate Dems -- led by Jeff Merkley -- request investigation into whether Mulvaney violated the Hatch Act when discussing campaign donations before a group of bank lobbyists last week I love seeing our map fill up with pins from Oregonians who've traveled across the country to take part in our democracy! Thanks for stopping by, @aslaoregon. … Ended a long day of travel yesterday to every corner of Linn County discussing the area with the folks who know it best—@dhnews staff! Over pizza at Ciddici’s in Albany is always best. pic.twitter.com/TLrHvYYS8C The new deputy at the EPA is a former coal lobbyist who has focused his career on rolling back environmental regulations - which is why I opposed him. We need an EPA that fights for clean air and water, not for the fossil fuel industry. #TodaysClimateFact … Thanks to all the folks keeping our #WeThePeople democracy alive by coming to my Linn County #TownHall today.

Thanks to climate change, more heatwaves are on the way. #TodaysClimateFact … This #WorkersMemorialDay, let us remember those who have suffered and died on the job. Especially in these trying times, we need to renew the fight for the workplace safety standards that keep our country’s hardworking women and men returning to their families at night. Congratulations to @OregonWVC on their 10th conference connecting and honoring women veterans. They stood up for our country, and we owe them a great debt. I will continue to fight for the resources they deserve. #WVC   The largest solar project in the world? Saudi Arabia may be famous for its oil, but this nation sees that the future is in renewables. #TodaysClimateFact … Look who I bumped into today.

Here is a critical & powerful new contribution to that work, thanks to @eji_org: … Mr. Mulvaney - you’ve made it clear that your congressional office was for sale. Does the @CFPB have a price tag too? -SB  …pic.twitter.com/cM4jC7wG0o Bravo to our neighbor to the north, WA, for acting to ban toxic PFAS chemicals! We need an @EPA that we can trust to take on this issue nationwide – not one that, under Scott Pruitt, keeps putting industry profits ahead of human health. … Last fall, I heard directly from #Flint residents about how the water crisis is still affecting their community. It's been 4 years and there is still so much work ahead to guarantee clean water and rebuild trust. We need to do better. #DontForgetFlintpic.twitter.com/1mvgrmWi4t This is what corruption looks like. #DrainTheSwamppic.twitter.com/2w1OIQCLtt Beach vacation with a side of… sharks?

Today, I’m joining @RepRaulGrijalva @SenatorCantwell @RepHuffman to tell @SecretaryZinke: Enough. Stop this dangerous, ill-conceived leasing plan. #SaveTheArcticpic.twitter.com/71EpnpoN0R Thank you @RepRaulGrijalva @SenatorCantwell @RepHuffman @SenJeffMerkley for leading a Democratic letter to @SecretaryZinke today calling on him to stop a 2019 oil and gas lease sale in the Beaufort Sea. #ProtectOurCoast #Alaskapic.twitter.com/l5dalBZpnE .@SenJeffMerkley asks "what kind of fairness do you anticipate before a judge ardently opposed to freedom of opportunity for LGBT Americans?"   We need federal judges who will apply the law fairly and equally. Kyle Duncan doesn't fit that bill. #courtsmatter #StopDuncanpic.twitter.com/WIhZjqv0Wa “[Kyle Duncan] is an ardent opponent to equality and opportunity for the #LGBTQ community here in the United States of America. He is recognized as one of our nation’s leading opponents of opportunity for the LGBTQ community.” - @SenJeffMerkley #CourtsMatter #StopDuncan A stark wakeup call: carbon emissions are once again trending in a dangerous direction. We need to do more to promote clean, sustainable energy. #100by50 #TodaysClimateFact … Just voted NO on Pompeo. Here's why: -He's deeply embedded with the fossil fuel industry; Sec of State should lead the climate fight -He believes Trump has power to go to war without Congress -Doesn't believe in diplomacy & attacks Muslim + LGBTQ  RT if you agree: #StopPompeo!pic.twitter.com/cvl1cI3BMk @SenJeffMerkley: there are three issues with Pompeo — conflict of interest (on enviro issues), respect for rule of law (pompeo didn’t believe war powers premises), and suitability for diplomacy (on Iran, bigoted comments) .@SenJeffMerkley on the 5th Circuit nomination of Kyle Duncan: We are a #WeThePeople nation founded on equality, justice, and opportunity for all. That’s why this individual should never be on the floor of the Senate to be confirmed as a federal judge. #StopDuncanpic.twitter.com/8CyqaGm3Dy Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for opposing Trump's blank check for war. #AUMF  Pruitt’s questionable dealings with lobbyists and use of public office for self-aggrandizement started well before he got to the EPA. Someone with so little grasp of ethical standards has no business in public office. #BootPruitt … The melting of the Arctic has already begun to change the ocean’s currents, and it could “trigger dramatic changes in a short time.” #TodaysClimateFact … It’s been said that we’re the first generation to feel the effects of climate chaos, and the last generation that can do anything about it. #EarthDay reminds us: it’s up to all of us to #ActOnClimate.pic.twitter.com/ocEa3x5mjv That’s nonsensical and it’s dangerous for public safety, which is why I’ve joined with Democratic and Republican Senators alike – including @SenCoryGardner, @PattyMurray, @RonWyden, @LisaMurkowski & more – to push for the SAFE Banking Act. Right now, the conflict between state and federal laws is creating untenable situations – like legal cannabis businesses that have to operate in all-cash because no banks will serve them. The people of every state should have the choice to make the same decision Oregonians have by legalizing cannabis, and they shouldn’t have to fear retribution or conflict with the federal government. I applaud Senator Schumer for taking a bold stance for nationwide decriminalization. The American public’s views on this issue are shifting rapidly, and Congress needs to keep up. … “The ocean never forgets.” Unless we do more to mitigate climate change and reduce emissions, scientists say impacts such as ocean acidification may become irreversible. #TodaysClimateFact … We loved meeting Maile Pearl on the floor today! Hope we'll be seeing her again soon, @SenDuckworth. … This. … The women of the Senate are 100% right – we need to reform how Congress handles sexual harassment, and we need to do so now. The American people are looking to us for leadership, and there’s no excuse for further delay.pic.twitter.com/P9YjXrOaa5 It's #NationalHighFiveDay! Let's #tbt to this awesome moment between @RonWyden and @SenJeffMerkley #NeverForget pic.twitter.com/FwJQDKykzx Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for your work supporting #childcare & #AfterschoolWorks ! @childcareaware @afterschool4allpic.twitter.com/EOcJIuZXTa Natural gas may be the nation’s top power source, but as the costs of clean energy continue to fall, Western U.S. states are taking the lead in moving towards more sustainable energy sources. #TodaysClimateFact … Kudos to @ChrisMurphyCT and @SenJeffMerkley for a health care proposal that would give every American access to quality, affordable health care via the proven Medicare system … BREAKING: A new comprehensive bill “Choose Medicare Act” is being rolled out today.  From @ChrisMurphyCT and @JeffMerkley this bill creates a Medicare plan anyone can join. Details enjoy massive public support.  More to come later... follow if interested 1/pic.twitter.com/DM2uNzQ1X6 Thank you, @SenKamalaHarris @CoryBooker @SenatorBaldwin @senbrianschatz @SenatorShaheen @MartinHeinrich @SenBlumenthal @SenatorTomUdall @SenGillibrand for your support of a Medicare option for all! #ChooseMedicare Every American should be able to choose Medicare. The Choose Medicare Act puts consumers and businesses in the driver’s seat on the road to universal health care.pic.twitter.com/KPF1m0vhcR The Choose Medicare Act – new legislation that I’m introducing today with @ChrisMurphyCT – creates a Medicare option for all Americans not already covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Every American deserves the promise of access to a popular, affordable, high-quality health care option. Fortunately, we already have exactly such an option – and it’s called Medicare. 7 of California’s 10 largest modern wildfires have occurred in the last 15 years. Climate chaos is harming American communities by making wildfires more destructive, dangerous, and expensive. #TodaysClimateFact … LIVE now: I’m joining with @ChrisMurphyCT to introduce the Choose Medicare Act – legislation that would create a Medicare option for all Americans. Watch to learn more:   After a close loss the @trailblazers are ready to bounce back in Game 2 tonight! I’ll be rooting on #RipCity here in D.C.! Time after time, @realDonaldTrump mysteriously walks back any move to be tough on the Kremlin. WHY? Our President should be a watchdog for America, not a lapdog for Putin. … $250 BILLION in stock buybacks since the #GOPTaxScam was passed. Every day, the evidence piles up that this massive tax giveaway was always intended for the wealthy & powerful, not working Americans. #TaxDay … Even Shell agrees that reaching aggressive Paris Agreement targets is not only feasible, but already commercially and technologically viable. So what are we waiting for? #TodaysClimateFact … Thank you to @SenBlumenthal @SenWarren and @SenJeffMerkley! Your signatures on this petition put us that much closer to saving #NetNeutrality in the Senate.  #OneMoreVote … Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for drawing attention to the needs of women, especially refugees, who suffer disproportionately in any crisis, and about the important role of @UNFPA in meeting their needs.  #FundUNFPA #WithRefugeespic.twitter.com/A4IdY9jnyD With 30 signatures on this petition, @SenateDems can and will force a vote on the CRA resolution to save #NetNeutrality.  Soon, the only thing that will stand between us and victory in the Senate is #OneMoreVote from a Republican Senator. Help us win this and raise your voices!pic.twitter.com/3QLKWvAHHg I visited South Sudan at the end of March and the situation there is heartbreaking. People on the ground told me US aid is making a huge difference – now is the time to do more, not less. … It turns out Scott Pruitt's $43,000 phone booth was not only a massive waste of taxpayer money, it was also illegal. This disregard for our oversight laws is completely unacceptable for anyone, much less a cabinet official. Pruitt needs to go. #BootPruitt … #TodaysClimateFact: As climate chaos intensifies, megafires are occurring in the US and OR at far higher rates. We just hit America’s costliest wildfire-fighting season ever and fire seasons are 40-80 days longer. Our mission is clear: #ActOnClimate. … Infuriating: 30,000 elephants are still killed for their ivory each year. The UK knows that these magnificent animals need our protection. We should too. We must show leadership & reject @realDonaldTrump’s efforts to roll back the #ElephantTrophyBan. … We have learned in Afghanistan and Iraq the dangers of launching military actions without clearly articulated objectives and exit strategies. If the President wants to wage war, the American people and Congress need to be part of that decision. If President Trump is going to use military force he must seek congressional authorization. The power to make war rests with Congress in Article I of the Constitution. Bashar al-Assad has carried out a brutal campaign of attacks on his own people. The use of chemical weapons is unconscionable and he must be held accountable. But military action is not the only tool we have. Thank you, Linda! No family should have to lose a loved one to asbestos exposure. That's why it's time to #BanAsbestos now. … Make no mistake: Big banks want this legislation because they think it will help them weaken and evade the Volcker Rule. This is an attack on the common-sense idea that there should be a firewall between traditional banking and hedge fund-style gambling. … Congratulations to @LauralPorter for her induction to the @natasnw Silver Circle, a prestigious recognition of her many years of impactful journalism. Here’s to many more!  That’s why it’s critical for our nation to support programs like @multco-based Healthy Birth Initiatives—the only program in Oregon focusing on birth-related health disparities in the African American community. It is shocking and unacceptable that Black women are 3-4 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women. I’m proud to support @BlkMamasMatter and join with @SenKamalaHarris to honor this week as Black Maternal Health Week. As the planet warms, climate-related disasters are becoming the new normal. Over the past five years, Americans experienced at least 10 major disasters a year--double the average number of such events since 1980. #TodaysClimateFact … Thanks for stopping by, @drmichaellomax! It was great to talk about how to make college affordable to all, and the great work @UNCF is doing. #BetterFutures …
