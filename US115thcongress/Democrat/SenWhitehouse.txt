That’s banana republic stuff, not America. Getting rid of #Rosenstein will be another “spine check” on Rs who have so far mostly shown spines of foam. … #SupremeCourt “crisis of legitimacy”? Roberts not giving the right wing wins over 90% of the time in 80 cases he has decided by partisan 5-4 majorities might be a good start. … News of a second sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh is being rebutted by Republicans on grounds that it’s not “corroborated." They stopped the FBI investigation that might have corroborated Professor Ford’s testimony and now complain about corroboration?  Unbelievable. This time, the stakes are even higher. … To illustrate the intense pressure big special interests put on Rs, here’s an email #Kavanaugh himself received when he was running nominations for Bush, in which Leo & the @FedSoc call for “bashed kneecaps & blood” after the defeat of one of their lower court nominees.pic.twitter.com/8X20PD8jSE Leo is the GOP’s #darkmoney judicial puppet master. He arranged a $1 million dark money donation to @realDonaldTrump’s inauguration. Now he’s orchestrated a multimillion dollar dark money campaign to secure #Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Don’t know who Leonard Leo is? @politico calls him the #3 person driving American politics. He’s EVP of @FedSoc. And like Whelan, he’s an old friend of #Kavanaugh. They’ve all been pushing the insulting theory that Dr. Ford was just “mixed up,” and Whelan somehow got Ford’s name before it was ever published. … Whelan has long been at the center of the @FedSoc’s secretive & powerful inner circle. He’s close friends with #Kavanaugh & has been scheming with Leonard Leo about how to salvage this fast-sinking nomination. … Like former McCain adviser @SteveSchmidtSES, I have a hard time believing Ed Whelan when he says he didn’t coordinate his crackpot “doppelganger” theory with #Kavanaugh, the @WhiteHouse, and @SenateGOP. … Bravo, Dr. Ford. It is even braver that you are coming forward given kangaroo hearing with investigation blocked by #Republicans.pic.twitter.com/8D2s2qdxa0 If #Kavanaugh did nothing wrong, he should want his name cleared.  Instead, he’s gone along with this, offering blanket denials and backing a phony process that undermines his credibility. And if I were #Kavanaugh, and I cared the smallest bit for my reputation & authority as a jurist, I would part ways with this #Republican charade and demand we go back to square one:  an @FBI investigation. #Republicans should respect Dr. Ford’s wishes, as they should respect the wishes of all victims of sexual assault. Next week’s hearing, as currently contemplated, will be a kangaroo court, because the #Republicans have done everything in their power to prevent the consideration of any outside evidence, whether corroborating or exculpatory. Even in accommodating Dr. Ford’s request for a few additional days, Chairman @ChuckGrassley has rejected many of her reasonable requests to ensure a fair process. She did so in spite of #Republicans’ astounding disregard for basic due process in failing to order the completion of a background investigation. That shows impressive courage on her part and lends her even more credibility. Dr. Blasey Ford made it clear to @senjudiciary she is willing to testify next week with reasonable precautions for her safety & ground rules to ensure a fair hearing.

Thank you @SenAmyKlobuchar & @SenKamalaHarris. … It is telling that Ford wants the investigation and #Kavanaugh doesn’t. … A distinguished retired federal judge adds her thoughts as to why @FBI investigation of Professor Ford’s assertions is necessary and appropriate, and would — except for the political torque on this — be customary. … In case you were wondering about the politics of #Republicans denying a woman with a credible allegation of sexual assault the simplest courtesy of a proper investigation of her claims, hold your nose and read this. … At the Meadows Senior Center, I spoke with residents about a number of pressing issues including the cost of health care. We need reforms that lower prescription drug prices and strengthen #Medicare and #Medicaid.

It's the responsibility of Congress to hold the admin accountable. … Like many of #Trump’s appointees, @EPA's Asst Admin Bill Wehrum is a “walking conflict of interest” given his close ties to the industries he was appointed to regulate.

Not a hard call here, folks. … I also succeed in including my bipartisan amendment with @SenBillCassidy, which requires @HHSGov to update Congress on a long-overdue set of rules to help limit blocking of important electronic health information. I've fought tirelessly to fund high-quality medical education for residents training at children’s hospitals. The bill includes a $10M increase in funding for these hospitals, including Bradley Hospital. The bill also includes a $2B increase for research through the @NIH & more money for the BRAIN initiative & Institutional Development Awards, which support research centers of excellence at #RI institutions like @RIHospital's Center on Opioids and Overdose. The bill also includes $350M for the Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program to relieve the financial burden for eligible student borrowers working in public service—people like teachers, social workers, and military personnel. This funding bill will dedicate $3.8B to fight the opioid crisis nationwide & in RI. Some of that money will go to programs created through my bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. The legislation we just passed to fund federal defense, labor, health, and education agencies includes a number of important victories for Rhode Island. … This likewise explains their refusal to call Mark Judge, the only other person she alleges was in the room during the assault. In what world is his testimony not 100% essential? The reality is that there is no investigative plan, and the #Republicans don’t want one, because they want to hang Dr. Ford out there on her testimony alone without any benefit of corroborating evidence. Really? When? Who will locate & interview witnesses? Has @senjudiciary hired independent investigators we don’t know about? When will the witness statements be taken? When will they be shared? Will the minority get to call witnesses, or will the #Republicans hold all the cards? … This editorial lauds #RI’s Deepwater Wind getting it right (again) working with fishermen. The process can work if all parties are seated at the table. … In 1991, Senate Republicans said an FBI investigation was the “the very right thing to do” – but now, those same Republicans insist the FBI cannot investigate whether Judge Kavanaugh committed sexual assault. Why?pic.twitter.com/75dk6GCZMH On @npratc, @SenWhitehouse says he'd be "ashamed" to participate in a judiciary committee hearing if Judge Kavanaugh is the only witness: "I would be very reluctant to provide that veneer of credibility to something that is so clearly a kangaroo hearing." If #Kavanaugh won’t insist the @FBI complete his background investigation as to this new allegation, he is unfit to serve as a federal judge. It is not a small matter for a federal judge to participate in a kangaroo hearing. Survivors deserve to be heard and respected, not attacked and smeared.   #Republicans’ reflexive, dismissive response makes victims like Dr. Ford understandably reluctant to come forward. As AG, I oversaw our domestic violence unit and I’ve worked with victims for years; the #Republican stampede violates every principle we have learned about respecting victims. They should be ashamed. More than anything, victims deserve a sincere and thorough investigation that digs out corroborating evidence, not being forced to stand alone with no investigation of their claims. Epic #Republican fail on that. She has put her own physical safety in jeopardy, coming forward with credible allegations of sexual assault against a powerful man backed by powerful forces; death threats have forced her into hiding. Dr. Ford is incredibly brave & very credible. Her story is rich in remembered detail, corresponds to facts that are known, and was told to others years before. .@realDonaldTrump and @SenateGOP should follow protocol and order the @FBI to complete its background investigation as to this claim. This process has been off the rails for a long time now, but the last 24 hours signal a new low. … This morning, the President said it is up to Dr. Blasey Ford to convince him she is telling the truth. That is preposterous. Her story is credible: it is rich in remembered detail, corresponds to facts that are known, and was told to others years before.pic.twitter.com/kmd9lWwLog One way to insult and disrespect Dr. Ford is to refuse her the basic courtesy of a meaningful investigation of her claim. Any victim deserves that. Why stop the background investigation for this? … The #MusicModernizationAct will also help their music find a broader audience by streamlining the burdensome licensing process. Updating our licensing and royalties laws is a win for creators, publishers, and fans of great music. #RhodeIsland is home to talented musicians and a vibrant music scene.  As more of us stream our music online, the bipartisan #MusicModernizationAct will help make sure the songwriters who compose the music we love are paid fair value for their work. … It’s hard to push back against this complete nonsense from #Republicans, it’s hard to even find a foothold in fact to push back against. … .@realDonaldTrump doesn’t have to “imagine.” Dr. Ford’s allegation is credible. And we have the @FBI to do the customary background investigation as to this incident.   Who’s stopping them? Ridiculous. … Once again, the BIG question here is coordination or collusion between House “investigators” and @realDonaldTrump’s legal team. What have the communications been? Is the House aiding or abetting obstruction? This is a big question to ignore. … .@JRubinBlogger : “You do wonder whose side #Trump is on.” The answer is, his own. At whatever cost to our country. … Great news! Court lifts Roberts stay and transparency decision can be implemented! A blow to creepy #darkmoney forces. … #Darkmoney political group calls #Kavanaugh victim statement a “last-minute smear campaign.” Bet the funders wouldn’t be so fast with that if they weren’t hiding behind anonymity: … How did we “time” Dr. Ford deciding to come forward after the hearing? Did we also “time” her talking to her husband & her therapist about the assault several years ago? … She is absolutely right. Investigation first; then hearing. It’s amazing #Republicans think this is even debatable. Her position puts the @senjudiciary Committee hearing scheduled for Monday in doubt. … We have a lot of work left to do on #opioid recovery in #RhodeIsland and the #OpioidCrisisResponse Act will help us keep making progress. It’s been a good week for the recovery community.pic.twitter.com/HYpvbyOu3X .@RealDonaldTrump just claimed that re-opening Kavanaugh’s official background investigation isn’t something the FBI does. FALSE. It's exactly what the FBI does. Until now it’s been a standard bipartisan process to have the FBI investigate new information raised about a nominee. Any person who comes forward as a victim of sexual assault deserves at minimum a respectful, thorough and sincere investigation. #Republicans denying Professor Ford that should be ashamed. These commitments are bold, but if we are to have any hope of keeping global warming under 2° C, we are also going to need leadership here in Washington. We need a federal price on carbon. #TimeToWakeUp … For my 220th “#TimeToWakeUp” speech, I highlight some of the steps states, cities, companies, and NGOs around the world are taking to reduce carbon emissions. … This past Friday, I attended the @GCAS2018 - organized by @JerryBrownGov - to keep up progress reducing carbon emissions & fighting the effects of #climatechange.pic.twitter.com/bBQNJUfjFh This is not acceptable. When is the @FBI going to do the investigation? AFTER the hearing? That would be ridiculous. Never?  That would just be wrong — very wrong. … Why did @SenateMajLdr pick Monday for #Kavanaugh sexual assault hearings?  Was it after consultation with @FBI about when a proper investigation would be done? Isn’t that the timing that matters right now? They would also permit sharing of important data on #opioid prescribing & help test incentives for behavioral health care providers to adopt electronic health records. My provisions would increase the amount of funding allowed for first responder training, #opioid-related infant care, awareness, and recovery programs. I've been working with #RI’s recovery community, first responders, health care providers, and others on the front lines of this crisis to put forward practical, effective solutions like the provisions in this bill.   I am proud to see our work advance. Proud to support the bipartisan #OpioidCrisis Response Act, which just passed the Senate.   We know #RhodeIsland can turn the tide against the opioid crisis, and we draw strength from the inspiring people walking the long, noble path of recovery. … Nothing about this matter has been said under oath so far. All parties and witnesses to this episode need to be formally interviewed by law enforcement professionals. Until that is done, nothing else should be. … Years of prosecutorial experience tell me that there is only one way to proceed on Professor Ford’s allegations: proper investigation by the nonpartisan career experts at the @FBI. Washington hears nothing when nature roars, because too many fossil fuel fingers are in politicians’ ears, and too much fossil fuel money is in politicians’ pockets. … Glad to see @CentralFalls_RI, the Nuisance Task Force, and @PCF_Development collaborating to replace a derelict property with a new two-family home.

There's a lot of information we don't know and the FBI should have the time it needs to review this new material. Staff calls aren't the appropriate way to handle this. #Kavanaugh’s blanket denial cannot be reconciled with her specific recollections, and the @FBI needs time to take proper witness statements.   Lying to an #FBI agent in a formal interview is a crime, and an impeachable offense. … I admire the courage Ms. Ford has shown in coming forward with her story. This requires a pause, at a minimum, in the unseemly, special-interest-funded rush to put Brett #Kavanaugh on the Court.pic.twitter.com/aYLwAIcFJM It was a privilege to join @SenJackReed, @JimLangevin, and @DavidCicilline to rename the Bristol Post Office in honor of First Sergeant Andrew McKenna.

This amendment will show how we can improve the efficiency of the grid, while saving consumers money on their energy bills. Businesses are coming up with innovative ways to take #carbonpollution out of the air & put it to use. #Carbonutilization is a growing sector in states like #RhodeIsland.   The spending bill includes my provision pushing @ENERGY to spend $12 million to continue R&D. In a bipartisan effort, Sen. @MikeCrapo & I worked on an amendment which will provide $20M to create a DOE pilot program to recycle spent fuel. @ENERGY estimated dealing w our existing nuclear waste could cost as much as $100B; this amndt could help alleviate some of that burden. I’ve long championed increasing the Corps’ role in supporting local efforts to boost ocean & coastal ecosystem resiliency from climate change. The spending bill supports this work. My provision in the spending bill directs the Corps to explain this funding gap & ensure coastal projects in states like #RhodeIsland are not being shorted. Under the Corps’ flooding & storm damage program, there's a continuing & unexplained disparity in funding between inland & coastal projects. This will help clear rivers & canals often loaded with the remnants of their industrial past & other debris that can block redevelopment & use.   My 2016 #WRDA provision authorized the Army Corps to remove debris from both main navigation channels & recreational waterways. I’m glad the bipartisan energy-water spending bill includes my request directing the @usacehq to prioritize urban waterways, like the Providence River in #RhodeIsland, under its expanded marine debris removal authority, which I championed in the 2016 #WRDA. .@JohnKerry on stage at Oceans gathering of #GlobalClimateActionSummit.pic.twitter.com/4YdOeb5nMn "Given the solid scientific foundation on which climate change science rests, any controversies regarding climate change ... based on social, economic, or political arguments—rather than scientific arguments—should not be part of a science curriculum.” … .@NSTA: "no scientific controversy exists regarding the basic facts of climate change."  … BREAKING:  Time and again, on issue after issue, Judge Kavanaugh has misled the Senate, under oath, when a job promotion was on the line.

Under oath, he said, "I’ve—I know Jim Haynes, but it was not one of the nominations that I handled.” We continue to find more evidence that Judge Kavanaugh misled me and the Judiciary Committee under oath.

Instead, he ducked our questions and fed us the same ‘confirmation etiquette’ we are used to hearing from @realDonaldTrump judicial nominees about being an ‘umpire’ calling balls and strikes. During his hearings, #Kavanaugh could have pledged to help buck that trend, and reassured those with pre-existing conditions, women, consumers, workers, vulnerable communities, or victims of pollution. That pattern leaves Americans to wonder which of their rights, freedoms, and protections the Roberts Court may sign away next. The #SupremeCourt gives too many indications of having been captured by the far right.

That's like 100% responsibility. Appointed. Period. Done." #KavanaughHearings #HaltTheHearingpic.twitter.com/3DTAibvn7y Brett Kavanaugh has been telling the Senate Judiciary Committee that he never took a position on the constitutionality of whether a president can be indicted.

In other words, he believes that a sitting president cannot be indicted.   #StopKavanaugh … Also, here's the panel @SenWhitehouse is referencing. The question posed is "How many of you believe, as a matter of law, that a sitting president cannot be indicted during the term of office?"

Kavanaugh faced important questions on limits to executive power, as legal questions swirl around a President whose lawyer says he may refuse to respond to subpoenas from the Special Counsel.  His answers have been evasive and deeply problematic. 7/ … No one noticed because nothing was classified, confidential, sensitive or personal — which spotlights the problem. … For the record, I used text of so-called “committee confidential” documents in my opening statement on #Kavanaugh. I did not seek “permission” because I think the designation was invalid and without legal effect. @SenWhitehouse is on fire.  "I don't accept the legitimacy or validity of the committee confidential process. Lest silence imply consent--I think that the rule is as valid as if the Chairman announced he's repealed the rule of gravity." @SenWhitehouse adds to the chorus of complaints over document production process. Says the committee confidentiality rule isn't a valid rule. Says it is an illegitimate process. #KavanaughHearings The NYT has obtained some of the secret "committee confidential" Kavanaugh emails Republicans have kept secret, including one in which he challenges a description of Roe v Wade as the "settled law of the land." … The right-wing majority of Roberts Court rules overwhelmingly in favor of corporate and #Republican interests. #Kavanaugh is just as bad.

It is not unheard-of for a “substantial assistance” motion to be filed after sentencing, but it’s rare. The #Flynn plea is in; the sentencing memos are presumably complete; the question of “substantial assistance” — cooperation — is the logical reason for postponement.

He also could not commit to upholding the lawful use of subpoenas against the @WhiteHouse/ the president, as affirmed in United States v.

The latest FEC gimmick was to say anonymous spending for political ads could stay secret unless the donor specified which political ad the dark money would go to support.   Obviously, ridiculous. But it let the FEC keep protecting #darkmoney power. If you want to read Chief Judge Howell’s 113-page decision, here it is:  .   The back story: #Republicans have deadlocked the FEC to prevent election enforcement for more than a decade.   This order could force the agency at last to follow the law. With the #VRA gutted, legislatures in states with a history of abuse of minorities at the polls went straight to work passing laws to deny access.   Let’s keep up the fight to restore the fundamental protections of the Voting Rights Act. Today marks the 53rd anniversary of the #VotingRightsAct. In 2013, the Supreme Court wiped out some of that law’s critical barriers to discrimination.   @realDonaldTrump’s #SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh must show he will fully and fairly uphold federal voting rights laws. … I agree with Koch Industries’ general counsel Mark Holden that the Koch network is not “an appendage of the #Republican Party.”  It’s the other way around. … This could actually be the  biggest political news of the year, if it disables the #darkmoney forces that have captured our democracy.

I don’t expect it from an industry that made a show of doing right by the American people and our environment.  … This new rule represents automakers breaking their word to the American people. Then #Koch front groups, sensing opportunity to sell more polluting products, have also rushed in to roll back these important protections. The standards would save American motorists $1.7 trillion over the life of their vehicles, and reduce the pollution driving climate change and dirtying our air in downwind states like #RhodeIsland.   The companies had the technology to do it.  It was going to be a win-win. The #Trump administration released a proposal to roll back critical fuel economy standards for cars and trucks.

Is this coordinated? Why not disclose? … Alexis de Tocqueville observed that the jury should be understood as ‘one mode of popular sovereignty.’ Jury service gives citizens direct exercise of an American constitutional power. Denying Americans access to a civil jury denies them fundamental constitutional prerogatives. The Founders had more in mind for this institution of government when they protected the civil jury in our Constitution’s Bill of Rights. Such victories have allowed corporations to steer plaintiffs out of courtrooms and into arbitration, where the odds can be stacked in favor of big business. Corporate victories at the Supreme Court have undermined civil litigants’ constitutional right to have their claims heard before a jury of their peers, and have whittled to a nub the protective role courts and the jury system were designed to play in our society. Over the past decade, a predictable conservative majority of the Supreme Court has handed down an accommodating string of 5-4 decisions closing off ordinary citizens’ pathways to the courtroom. Today, I filed a friend-of-the-court brief with the Supreme Court in New Prime, Inc. v. Dominic Oliveira arguing in favor of workers’ rights to settle disputes in court.

Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, was involved in highly contentious debates in George W. Bush's administration.

And I’m grateful for the work you’re doing – keep it up! … .@realDonaldTrump needs to reassure the American people that he is not in sway of Vladimir Putin by releasing tax returns.  The question “what’s he hiding” is now urgent. In one voice, our intelligence community determined Russia meddled in the 2016 election, and warns us that Russians are meddling NOW.  “Protect and Defend”? The United States ought never to turn over law-abiding Americans for interrogation by foreign enemies.  Ever. Very proud of the bipartisan Senate resolution stating unequivocally that the Senate opposes making American citizens “available” to Putin for questioning. Whales at the #BlockIslandWindFarm today! Watch them blow water at the end of the clip. Amazing. … LIVE WH vigil confronting corruption, demanding democracy, and defending the Mueller investigation. … First, what happened in that private meeting?  Second, what do tax returns disclose about vulnerabilities?  No excuses. This appears at odds both with the known facts and the “protect and defend” part of his presidential oath of office. We need answers. Maybe @realDonaldTrump “misspoke” again and no meant yes. Or maybe Trump is falsely denying an ongoing attack by a foreign adversary. … Saddened by the passing of Marlene McCarthy, a tireless advocate for ending breast cancer. I loved working with Marlene, and her legacy will live on with the RI Breast Cancer Coalition. … The corrupt #darkmoney machine inches forward, claiming more territory.

Today at sundown, join me and Americans across the country in mobilizing to #ConfrontCorruption and demand democracy. We cannot remain silent. … Typical. Sadly, @WSJ ed page can be counted on to deny climate change and flack for #darkmoney power of big special interests. Two sides of the same coin for polluters. Yuck. … .@realDonaldTrump grovels to Russia; @HouseGOP persist in harassing #TrumpRussia investigation. Still no answers on communication between Trump team and House “investigators.” … Best parts: @realDonaldTrump’s “departure point for speech and thought is not objective reality”; it‘s “clear whose side Mr. Trump was on, and ‘it isn’t ours’”; and Trump is “best president Russia has ever had.” … It all comes back to sanctions, which infuriate Putin by making it harder for his cronies to move/spend ill-gotten gains abroad. Newly-arrested Russian Butina had asked @realDonaldTrump at 2015 presser about what? Removing sanctions. … Notice #Putin’s odd reference to Bill Browder? Browder drove the Magnitsky Act; Act sanctioned Russian officials; sanctions are Putin’s soft spot. Russia hit back by stopping adoptions, which is why “adoptions” came up in the #Trump Tower meeting. … George Will, arch-Republican, smashes Trump & echoes my question about #TrumpTaxReturns, which @realDonaldTrump’s creepy-crawly #Helsinki performance has put back front and center. Yesterday’s laughable walk back attempt does not erase the question: WHY?? … Republican strategist @murphymike: Trump in #Helsinki "damn near traitorous"; "the most depressing, disgusting, toadying, weak, moronic, [and] lie-stuffed" in the "long history of the American presidency." The stakes are high for the environment with the nomination of Kavanaugh to fill the #SCOTUS vacancy.   He’s made it harder for states and @EPA to address #climatechange, and he’s consistently sided with big corporations over protecting the American people. #StopKavanaughpic.twitter.com/1iNOcXAlwU Joining @SenatorCarper and my @SenateDems colleagues to talk about Brett #Kavanaugh’s attacks on the environment. He’s overturned @EPA regulations to protect the air we breathe and water we drink because he deemed them too expensive for corporations.  … So @FERChatterjee, son of Kentucky, former Mitch McConnell aid and Trump appointed FERC commissioner, really wants you to know he believes in climate change.   But what does that mean for FERC, America's top energy regulator? I take a look … This is latest attempt by @stevenmnuchin1 and @realDonaldTrump to cover up the facts and keep lawmakers off the #FollowTheMoney trail. … Time to see the #Trumptaxreturns, and see what they may show about why Trump grovels around #Putin.  Is there not one congressional committee that will have a look? With @realdonaldTrump so abjectly weak against #Putin in public, we need to know more about the private meeting.  What else did he give away or promise?  More than that, we need to understand what is driving Trump to be so obsequious to Putin. Americans should be very worried about what #SCOTUS Justice #Kavanaugh would mean for our air, water, health, & climate. @SenatorCarper, @SenWhitehouse & I are joined by climate & environmental leaders to highlight the anti-environment record of Kavanaugh:  pic.twitter.com/3eOy39EEF8 When Lavrov says #Trump talks were “magnificent,” our alarm bells should be screaming. Pompeo/Bolton/Kelly new Lavrov Lapdog Brigade? Pathetic. … We were attacked.   We know who did it.   The President embraces them, denies the cyber attacks and attacks the US intelligence community.   The attacks from Russia will continue unless met with strength.   The President is weak and complicit in the ongoing attacks.   Enough! Today has been a disgraceful day. It is also an accountability day for Republicans. How much of this un-American nonsense will they tolerate? Days after the Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers for interference in our elections, @realDonaldTrump still refuses to believe American intelligence over Vladmir Putin.pic.twitter.com/4phxz1w80H Today’s press conference in #Helsinki was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.  My full statement on the #HelsinkiSummit:  … #Putin: "We should be guided by facts. Could you name a single fact that would definitively prove the collusion?"  #Mueller:  25 indicted Russians. .@realDonaldTrump's statements today are deeply unnerving, as is his abandonment of many of our closest allies in recent days. Read my entire statement:  … #HelsinkiSummit He refused to hold #Russia accountable for interference in the 2016 election, and refused to credit the analysis of the U.S. intelligence community over the empty word of Vladimir #Putin. The president just stood next to the authoritarian ruler of a hostile power and blamed the state of our bilateral relationship on American ‘foolishness.’ #HelsinkiSummitpic.twitter.com/qVIxqqwelY It gets worse. The 5-4 Court gave McConnell the Citizens United decision, so unlimited money could see to it he kept his “majority,” so they could keep the 5-4 partisan Court. At the heart of all of it, is the same right-wing billionaire influence. … How I love seeing these documents. Amid all the lies and poisonous nonsense emitted around this investigation, the pleadings’ simple, clear factual language, and familiar format and phrasing, are a reassurance that all is not haywire.  … The case of the 12 indicted Russians has been referred to the @TheJusticeDept National Security Division. That puts #Trump-related investigative work in NSD, EDVA, SDNY, Criminal Division and Special Counsel, makes it damned hard to uproot by firings. Thank you again Senator @JohnBoozman for leading the SRF WIN Act. It will help provide competitive water infrastructure financing for smaller cities and communities in Rhode Island.

But that’s not why Mueller will take his time and do the investigation right; he’ll do that because of who he is. Scientists should be able to teach science without politicians censoring them. #ActOnClimate Today, I joined a resolution w/ @SenWhitehouse to fight Republicans’ attempt to silence scientists and stifle @NSF climate research.

Why? Brian Benczkowski refuses to recuse himself from the #Russiainvestigation despite his deep ties to a Putin-connected bank. TODAY @SenateGOP is quietly pushing a vote on Brian #Benczkowski to head @TheJusticeDept Criminal Division. This vote will have MAJOR implications on the investigation into Russian meddling with the #Trump campaign and our elections. Today Senate Republicans have scheduled the first procedural vote on the nomination of Brian Benczkowski to head the DOJ Criminal Division. Mr. Benczkowski is the wrong person for this job. Remember Brian Benczkowski? He represented Russia’s Alfa Bank and was a top staffer to then-Senator Sessions. Senate Republicans plan to vote next week to confirm him to head the DOJ Criminal Division.

The sad part is that it was the cascade of little sleazy acts that brought Pruitt down, not his overarching corruption by fossil fuel interests.  The National Coastal Resilience Fund, which I helped create to mitigate the effects of climate change, is now accepting proposals. Here’s how you can apply for federal funding for projects that will protect our coastal economy and way of life:  … 30 years in, and it’s still oil companies’ “alleged role in climate change”?  Oy.  And whose water is NAM carrying?  There’s a lot of manufacturing in clean energy.  I wonder who funds them. … If you have 9 minutes for ocean plastics, this is a cute and accurate video.  The House is working on virtually identical marine plastics legislation to mine, and I hope we can make it law soon.

We need to be ready for that.  (Note picture.  Fox just can’t quit.) … The Ocean State has so much at stake in the fight against climate change. I commend @AGKilmartin for his leadership in holding some of the world’s most powerful corporations responsible for the damage they’re inflicting on our coastal economy, infrastructure, and way of life. … I agree with @lawyer_moms – #FamiliesBelongTogether and every child taken away from their parents because of @realdonaldtrump's policy needs to be immediately reunited with their family.pic.twitter.com/SHgrZgvOx8 A small number of rogue gun dealers are responsible for many of the guns that end up in the wrong hands.

Well, we agree, Mitch. That’s why we introduced the DISCLOSE Act. Hope you support it too.   Can you guess who once said election spending should be “limited and       disclosed” so that “everyone knows who’s supporting everyone else”? Secret election spending has exploded since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision and it’s drowning out Americans’ voices.

Read it here:  … This crisis is not over.   Thousands of families are still separated with no plan to reunite them.   “Zero tolerance” is still official U.S. policy.   Trump’s new order seeks to indefinitely detain children & families.   Your voices are still needed. RT to spread the word. I'm proud Americans are making it clear to @realDonaldTrump that they're outraged and they won't be ignored. Thanks to everyone at the Coalition to Value Families rally against Trump's child separation policy today. You’re right--this isn't over. We need to keep fighting.pic.twitter.com/UmMByfNOE7 I’m proud of the American people’s outrage at separating little children from moms and dads.  Trump caved, because America sent a loud, firm message of our decency.  To all who made their voices heard, thank you and God bless you.  Keep the faith. .@SenWhitehouse to @realdonaldtrump’s nominees to be assistant administrators @EPA: will you have staffers run errands for you? For instance, to pick up fancy lotion or track down used mattresses?pic.twitter.com/YvEchrrPVw Here's my statement on @realDonaldTrump's child separation #ExecutiveOrderpic.twitter.com/uqUZLJgBCc Madonna and childpic.twitter.com/mQ90j8kymz It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to stop lying.  As senior Trump officials – including members of his own cabinet- have said, the Trump administration is responsible for the policy that separates children from their families at the border. WATCH:pic.twitter.com/kFjzar2EW9 Swamp, much? … We've got a 10-lane highway for Russian dirty money to enter the US via shell companies, and yet the House Financial Services Committee just removed language from a bill that would require companies to disclose their "true" (i.e. beneficial) owners.  Rhode Islanders have lost far too many loved ones, friends, and neighbors to opioid overdoses. I was pleased to work with my colleagues in the delegation to make this increased funding available to help RI fight the epidemic.  … It is absolutely not necessary to prosecute every single asylum seeker who crosses the border in the wrong place.pic.twitter.com/oP7Gq2RCYJ People crossing the border may be poor and frightened and seeking the safety that the United States has long represented for refugees.pic.twitter.com/iasKnvYEfk Nothing about all of the administration’s explanations looks as bad as the image of children behind chain link fences under Mylar blankets, and the sounds of them crying in captivity.pic.twitter.com/xT4KwgQLiE Always great to see the excellent advocates from @PanCANRI, who are in DC today to #DemandBetter for pancreatic cancer patients and their families. Proud to stand with them.pic.twitter.com/hpvGhIAoPL Thank you @alzassocri for playing an such important role in the fight against this disease. … The administration’s current family separation policy is an affront to the decency of the American people, and contrary to principles and values upon which our nation was founded. The administration has the power to rescind this policy. It should do so now. On the heartless Trump tactic of separating little children from mothers, it’s not just their lying that gets me; they no longer even try & get their lies straight w/ each other. It’s like a County Liars Fair: blue ribbon to Sessions for “the Bible made me” … Our Jim Langevin is a national authority on this important subject.   Always making us proud. … The real Trump Hotel.pic.twitter.com/PP6nIbzNQR Sentences I’d hope never to read about USA:  “Inside an old warehouse in South Texas, hundreds of children wait in a series of cages created by metal fencing. One cage had 20 children inside.” … CRMC,through #RIBeachSAMP , has developed the best flood, storm event maps for RI (instead of FEMA’s outdated ones) … And thank you, @laurawbush. … .@SethMacFarlane shows his #RISD!   Thank you, Seth. … Under Trump, no admission of wrongdoing and a fine of about 42 cents per attempted infraction by abusive corporate lender.  Government for sale in the Trump Swamp. … Conservative columnist @GeorgeWill re: @SenBobCorker calling Republicans “cultish”:  “It’s not a cult. ... This is fear. They’re not worshipful, they are invertebrates.”  … Thank you, @senorrinhatch, for the heartfelt “message of love” this #Pride month. … When Giuliani says the Department of Justice doesn’t prosecute witness tampering unless someone threatens to kill the witness his facts are simply wrong.   See U.S. Attorneys Manual Sec. 1729.  False statements like this signal panic and guilt. … Don’t count me among “Democrats [who] won’t like” Comey report.  He broke the rules.  His self-aggrandizing excuses were wrong.  He did good things in his career, but his Clinton investigation episode was bad. … A totally true-as-anything-Trump-says report from the Zone of Spinal Evaporation that surrounds the President (Enjoy!): … Now Lotion Man is in real trouble, using oily connections to bump Oklahoma Rose Bowl fans to get tickets to sold-out game for himself!   I doubt Sooners like swells cutting line to get tickets! … And now Manafort is headed for the can, making him more likely to flip.  Line up Flynn, Cohen and Manafort as cooperating prosecution witnesses and you’ve got a prospect that explains the panic in Trumpland. Today, OGE sent the @EPA Inspector General a letter about ongoing allegations of misconduct by Administrator Pruitt. You can read it here:   First it was, “We’re going after those DACA kids unless we get our Wall!”  Now it’s, “We’re taking little kids away from their parents unless we get our Wall!”  Enough with the political hostage-taking, already. … Whiff of Panic:  Trump/Giuliani/McCarthy all calling to end Mueller probe over @JusticeOIG report saying @Comey broke rules in way that helped Trump.  Follow THAT logic.  Cohen flip prospect must be making them crazy. If you’re feeling lawyery and want to read the legal complaint filed by the @NewYorkStateAG over Trumps’ abuse of the Trump Foundation, here it is.  It’s actually a pretty good read.    … Indeed.   One reason we are pushing to increase black sea bass limits as more come to RI from Mid-Atlantic coast.   One reason RI lobster fishery has fallen so hard.  One reason we need to strengthen Magnuson-Stevens.   Climate change at work. … Thank you, Senator Whitehouse, for recognizing this as an issue early on, for all your work & for bringing me in. It was an honor to testify and give the science on this issue. I'm also proud to continue my research at @universityofga & also now as a @NatGeo Explorer. #NatGeoFest I worked with @SenWhitehouse to add a provision to the FY2019 Energy and Water appropriations bill to recycle spent fuel for use in nuclear reactors.  … At 50-years-in-politics fete for @FredWertheimer, legendary among $$-in-politics reform advocates, @SenWhitehouse wishes him “50 more years of ass-kicking.”  Sen. @VanHollenForMD: Fred has “mastery of the system ... I’m glad this isn’t a retirement party.”pic.twitter.com/uc3OQd89Jb I have my father's flag from #WWII (in the triangle); and, two flags for my mother's service in WWII, thanks to @SenWhitehouse and @davidcicilline. One of her flags is flying and flapping to honor all who served/are serving on this #FlagDay....  …   much for those stooges at the @WSJopinion page and their fossil-fuel-funded climate denier pretending there’s no worry about sea level rise from climate change.  Oops! …  … Imagine the Republican explosion if this photo were Obama.  Some double standard. … Patients, doctors, nurses, and hospitals have come out in opposition to the effort to push low-quality junk health care plans. We’re telling @realdonaldtrump to abandon this dangerous policy. … Read my statement on the @JusticeOIG report.  … Tearing children away from their families is cruel. Not only is it wrong, but it can actually cause “irreparable harm to their future health,” according to @AmerAcadPeds. Let’s stop hurting children, because #FamiliesBelongTogether Beware bogus Republican talking points: Giuliani took years investigating “Tony” Salerno and no one told him to “wrap it up.”  Investigations can take time, and need to run their proper course. … And thanks again to @NatGeo for great images. From days when I first held hearing on this, and brought @JambeckResearch to speak at #EEODayRI, ocean plastics has exploded into serious effort by G7 (minus Trump), UN, hospitality chains, plastics industry, all over—now India! … A cosmic convergence of creeps. … Great piece on sea level rise, and a sad reminder that fossil-fuel-funded climate denial is still alive and well, and even given sanctuary still in the @WSJopinion pages.   A shame. … I saw the movie “Shock and Awe,” about the one news agency that got the story right in the Bush rush to war in Iraq. One hero: @JonathanLanday, son of the late Jerry Landay of Bristol.  Jerry was a great reporter in his own day.  Great job, Jonathan! Watch House Rs whine when the tables are turned and there is discussion of legal process to gain access to their documents. One key question:  what would those documents reveal about collusion between Trump lawyers and the House staff harassing DOJ? … In the effort to torpedo Obamacare, a new low from the Trump political appointees at the Department of Justice has driven a career lawyer out. … Thank you to the @universityofri professors for shining light into the lives of students at our state university. Your hard work and dedication benefits Rhode Islanders every day.pic.twitter.com/L2JJcQttaW We need to make sure RI shellfish farms have the certainty they need to keep growing and creating jobs. Oyster farmers deserve affordable insurance options tailored to their unique needs.  … Thank you to all the folks at @DayOneRI for the work you do every day to provide services for victims of assault and abuse in Rhode Island.pic.twitter.com/E2l2yX2lkk The Kochs maintain many such front groups, so this won’t clean up their dark money mess, but it’s still a good day for democracy. In a rare enforcement action, the IRS yanked the tax status of a Koch-funded front group called “Americans for Job Security” which had spent more than $20 million in political advertising.  … I’m grateful to have met with such strong advocates for suicide prevention from @AFSP_RI today. Free, confidential support & counseling is always available at 800-273-8255.pic.twitter.com/9enfc76LTf A crash takes place in a system when conditions in that system reach a tipping point, and the system rapidly destabilizes. Climate change has us on course for two big crashes, which is what I’ll discuss in this week’s Time to Wake Up speech. Tune in now!  … All of the items listed in the announcement have been echoed by past North Korean leaders. I hope we can progress beyond this list to a meaningful accord that yields lasting peace. A path to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is welcome, but the announcement President Trump and Chairman Kim made leaves many questions unanswered. Two years ago, 49 men & women were brutally gunned down at the Pulse nightclub shooting. Thoughts and prayers are not enough, so we must #HonorThemWithAction. It’s long past time we put an end to anti-LGBTQ hatred and vicious gun violence. Missed opportunity on ocean plastics in automatic Trump administration reflex to support any and all polluters. … There is a disturbing trend to the 5-4 decisions of the Court’s Republican appointees: they all seem to benefit the GOP at the polls (like this decision) or benefit big Republican corporate donor interests (like the recent Epic Systems decision). … The Trump Admin’s policy of systematically separating #immigrant families is costly, ineffective, & deliberately cruel. Joined @dii_of_ri & @SenWhitehouse in calling for passage of The Keep Families Together Act & bipartisan #immigration reform. #KeepFamiliesTogetherpic.twitter.com/iGRo2PBoa8 .@realDonaldTrump’s new policy of cruelly ripping children from their parents at the border is un-American & bad for kids’ health. @SenJackReed & I are calling on the Admin. to immediately stop this & join us in working toward bipartisan immigration reform.pic.twitter.com/FpNnGCFWIp Thanks to all who marched from all of us here in the Ocean State! … .@ProJo full of RI inspiration today:  Sister Mary and Sophia Academy; WWII Corsair pilot and Cranston Print Works CEO Fred Rockefeller; DeCubellis family mission honoring Katie.

Beautiful RI!pic.twitter.com/UQWXgmj5Yl And here’s three: … Here’s two: … Here’s one: … A broad array of respected and conservative voices converge in these three articles around two themes:  Trump Unhinged; and Republican Spinal Evaporation. “Oil companies, including ExxonMobil, have endorsed the Paris accord and have called for carbon taxes,” but their agents are busily working in Congress to prevent any such carbon tax. This is not honest dealing. I hope they do not try to fool the Pope. … Celebrating the many contributions Portuguese-Americans have made to RI at the Day of Portugal festival!pic.twitter.com/lECknae1Me Glad to join @SeaAhead on #WorldOceansDay yesterday to help plan for the future of blue tech innovation and jobs in RI.pic.twitter.com/pdpeOfOXSS Shouldn't there be an investigation into whether House Republicans shilling for Trump in the Russia inquiry are (pardon the word) colluding with the White House and therefore possibly guilty of obstruction and of destroying the very idea of oversight? … C’mon Boston, it’s not always about you guys! We’ve been doing this for years. … On #WorldOceansDay and every day, we must heed the warnings from our oceans and come together to turn the tide and save the seas from the harm we have caused. Earth, as we know it, depends on it.  “Our ocean defines our planet.” –Sir Attenborough … Um, $15 billion is less than 1% of what Republicans blew on tax cuts for their buddies and donors.  Good luck selling that as “fiscal discipline.”  Sorta like, “Dad, I wrecked the car, but it’s cool because I’m replacing the windshield wipers for you.” … Many of the patients who come through CODAC's doors are facing the most difficult time in their lives & they are met with lifesaving compassion & care from the staff here. I wrote #CARA so those on the front lines of this opioid addiction crisis would have the resources to help.pic.twitter.com/gFyWCtDvTq We are on our way to having more plastic in our oceans than living fish.   Thank you @NatGeo for your focus on this. … Pruitt nickname competition heats up!  I had “Very Important Pruitt” after his self description.  But should it be “Lotion Detector”?  “Big Snack Attack”?  “Used Hotel Mattress King”?  “Chick-Fil-A Magnet”?  Add your nominations! Some good examples to keep handy for future Trump lies. … .@ChuckGrassley starting to sound like @SenWhitehouse:   “You know how Big Oil has had Washington wired for a long time, and I think EPA is part of this Washington swamp . . . . ” … #NetNeutrality will officially end on Monday.

Today there was a court hearing about it. Read my statement here:  … .@SenWhitehouse: there's a feeling about oceans that most people have. The people in the audience today should feel they have the wind at their backs and can make change. #CHOW2018 Excited to join @marinesanctuary and ocean leaders @SenWhitehouse @RepRooney for discussion about what Congress can do to help the blue economy thrive. #CHOW2018pic.twitter.com/tp1JgMZBfK Mars, Inc., is a corporate leader in sustainability. So you can feel pretty good about those M&Ms. … Even after 55 years of the #EqualPayAct, women make 80 cents on the dollar compared to their male counterparts--even less for WOC.  Now’s the time to pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct to close the pervasive wage gap, reject gender pay discrimination, and strengthen our economy. Thank you, @SenJackReed and all the advocates and families who worked to pass the #STARAct. Proud to cosponsor this important bill. … Thanks, @SenBennetCo. Our bill will help low-carbon technologies find new uses in farming while reducing carbon pollution, benefiting both our climate and the rural economy. … Transforming carbon pollution into something useful ought to be part of our fight against climate change.  That’s why @SenBennetCO & I introduced our bill to help promising carbon capture technologies compete in new markets.   … I was happy to be a part of the #CHOW2018 congressional roundtable to discuss bipartisan legislative efforts that will protect our oceans and the communities that rely on them.pic.twitter.com/slrPWvWIn9 Pres Trump’s misguided health policies are forcing Americans to pay more for less health coverage because he's undermining insurance markets. Meanwhile, his chaotic approach to world affairs is forcing Americans to pay more at the pump.  Working families deserve better.pic.twitter.com/O3yqX4RPyS Generations of immigrants built this country. Yet too often, those who come seeking the American dream are met with discrimination.

Either way, Pruitt should go. … She’s right.  Pruitt is as swampy as you can get. … Tax bill:  “capital spending the tax cut was supposed to bring about isn’t showing up.”  No kidding.

I think he’s 0 for 5. The Trump Swamp just keeps getting swampier. … The one person most likely to be smiling as Trump sunders trade relations with the United States’ best allies is Vladimir Putin. Putin’s number one target (other than running his country as a murderous racketeering enterprise) is the Atlantic Alliance. … Congratulations to all the amazing athletes participating in @SORhodeIsland's 50th #StateSummerGames. RI is so proud of everything you have achieved! It was an honor to attend the VFW of RI’s 99th state convention to thank our veterans for their service.
