Yesterday, @SenateGOP scheduled a vote for #Kavanaugh before even hearing Dr. Ford testify. Today, they're disparaging Ms. Ramirez and Ms. Swetnick, all while refusing an FBI investigation.   The question of whether @SenateGOP cares about learning the truth has been answered. Multiple women have come forward. Sworn declarations have been made. It's past time to initiate an FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge #Kavanaugh.   If @SenateGOP is so certain no wrongdoing occurred, they should welcome one as well. What are they so afraid of? Before 2016, people often told me they didn't vote because they didn't think it would make a difference. I don't hear anyone saying that today.  2016 proved voting matters. It's how we speak truth to power, and make our views heard.   #RegisterToVote now:  In a few minutes, I'll be speaking on the need for all Americans, of all backgrounds and political affiliations, to #RegisterToVote. This is a critical year for our democracy. We can't afford to sit this one out.  Watch live:  … #NationalVoterRegistrationDay With all that's happening, we cannot forget that the most important voice in these debates will speak loud and clear on November 6: yours.  Now is not the time to sit on the sidelines. This #NationalVoterRegistrationDay make sure you're registered to vote:  My mother, Ruth Cummings, told me just before she passed: “Don't let them take the vote away from us.” During her 92 years of life, she fought for the right to vote and saw people die for it.   Today is #NationalVoterRegistrationDay. Make sure you can exercise this sacred right. Deputy AG Rosenstein is in charge of overseeing Mueller’s Russian interference investigation. So make no mistake: firing #Rosenstein would represent a direct attack on that investigation in a transparent effort to undermine it. There would be no other reasonable interpretation. Republican leadership has so far failed to protect the independence of Mueller’s Russian interference investigation, seeming to forget that Congress was designed to be an independent check on @POTUS. It’s time we start acting like it. #ProtectMueller This is a crisis. President Trump is treating our Justice Department like his own personal law firm. Congress needs to start being the adults in the room. It’s past time we pass legislation protecting Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. #Rosenstein In College Park celebrating new funding for our first responders. These funds will help supply @CPFD's incredible firefighters with the equipment they need to go about the dangerous business of keeping us safe. Grateful for their service & determined to keep them a top priority.pic.twitter.com/9xXs5ccsK3 Very pleased that my package of bills aimed at combating the #OpioidEpidemic was passed in the Senate this week. A truly comprehensive effort that touches every part of the problem & improves resources for first responders, researchers & recovery centers: … The #OpioidEpidemic is a pervasive and growing problem nationwide, and Maryland is no exception.  This week, the Senate took meaningful steps to combat it by passing of a series of bills I authored to improve both prevention and recovery outcomes: … Rushing, when it suits them, seems to be the Republican playbook for @SCOTUS #outrageous … Just met with the @Ravens to discuss the need for meaningful criminal justice reform – including the need to end the discriminatory practice of racial and religious profiling. These kinds of open, honest conversations are critical for progress. Sincere thanks to all the players.pic.twitter.com/AbylioUGCn Suggesting an attack is only real if immediately reported to police demonstrates sheer ignorance for how trauma unfolds for victims.  Repeat after me: sexual assault is traumatic to relive and retell. No one – especially not Donald J. Trump – should judge Dr. Ford's timing. … We must put an end to the suggestion that Americans must choose between their Constitutional rights and the safety of their families.  We are fully capable of having both, and we must insist that we do. We *can* reduce gun violence with commonsense measures that have already been introduced in Congress. There is no rational reason we should not close the loophole that allows some gun purchases to occur without a background check or reinstate the assault weapons ban. Finally: thoughts and prayers may provide some brief consolation, but taking definitive action so no other families have to go through today's pain and suffering is what is required. While we don't yet know the full circumstances of the handgun used in this shooting... Details are still emerging, but I've met with the Harford County Executive and Sheriff to offer my sincere condolences. I wanted to be there in person to thank them, as well as the many first responders and federal law enforcement on the scene for their swift responses. My heart is heavy as we are faced with the reality that a mass shooting – this time in Aberdeen – has again left families and friends in mourning. Loved ones went to work today, like any other day, but will not be coming home tonight. I'm in Aberdeen with @Harford_Sheriff, who are holding a press briefing on this morning's tragic shooting right now. Watch live here: … If you have information that could be helpful in the investigation of today’s shooting please call 410-838-5800 to pass your contact information to detectives. We can confirm there was a shooting in the area of Spesutia Road and Perryman Road.  Multiple victims.  The situation is still fluid.  Please avoid the area.  Media staging area still TBD. Just horrific. I'm monitoring this carefully, and urge residents to stay clear of the area until further notice. … America under @POTUS' failed leadership continues to turn its back on the most vulnerable, innocent people in the world. In the midst of the worst global refugee crisis since WWII, the U.S. should be leading by example. This cruelty is hard to understand. #RefugeesWelcome … Terrible. @POTUS can't get his wall built on the southern border because it's bad policy & impractical technology, but he'll stop at nothing to build metaphorical walls around our country, decimating our moral leadership and the values that define us as a people. #RefugeesWelcome … A worthy cause. As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, happy to see the Migratory Birds of the Americas Conservation Act advance w/ bipartisan support to help sustain birds like the Baltimore Oriole, and the habitats they rely on. #ProtectTheBirds … I want to thank @SenatorCardin for his leadership on reauthorizing the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act – important to both of our states. People travel to the Delaware to observe Red Knots, which benefit from this critical conservation law. -@SenatorCarper As we discuss the need to take the allegations against Judge #Kavanaugh seriously, let us remember one critical point: sexual assault is traumatic to relive and retell. We should not stand in judgment of Dr. Ford's timing. WATCH LIVE as @SenSchumer delivers floor remarks today calling for Sen. Grassley & the Judiciary Committee to postpone the vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination until the serious, credible allegations against him have been thoroughly investigated. … I join my colleagues in calling for a full and fair hearing regarding Dr. Ford’s allegations. Until then, a vote on Judge #Kavanaugh's confirmation must be delayed.

Sheer madness. … It's with both sadness and pride that I congratulate @DrLeanaWen on being named the new president of @PPFA. Her departure from @BMore_Healthy is a great loss for Baltimore City. But she will be a tremendous asset to @PPFA. No one is better suited to defend women's health care. … The concept of priorities utterly eludes this president. Millions of lives are at direct risk, yet @POTUS would rather divert funds from them in favor of an ill-conceived immigration agenda. Indefensible.  We should be building emergency shelters – not detention centers. #FEMA … Today, let us remember 9/11 by uniting as Americans. Let us remember the difference between patriotism – love of country, love for our neighbors – and nationalism, which can be divisive and angry. Let us remember what we can overcome when we practice respect, compassion and love. September 11th will forever be embedded in our consciousness. We remember the nearly 3,000 innocent souls we lost. We remember those who ran into flame & smoke to save others.  And we remember how strong we grew afterward, when we united under a single, powerful label: Americans. Judge #Kavanaugh's answers at this week's hearings did nothing to alleviate concern that he would turn back the clock on civil liberties, reproductive choice, equality, the Affordable Care Act, workers' rights, and clean air & clean water regulations. That should trouble us all. Momentous. This is what progress looks like.   Love is love is love. … In Montgomery County w/ medical practitioners, experts and advocates to discuss health policy.

I urge all my colleagues to think carefully, before they cast their vote, about the future of our nation. I have. And that is why I must vote no. #WhatsAtStake The 42,000-page document dump the night before the hearings began was an especially egregious display of contempt for the constitutional process. Even now, much of #Kavanaugh's record has not been provided to the Senate. Further, this whole process has been outrageous.  My request to meet with Judge #Kavanaugh before the hearings began was denied by the White House. I joined @JudiciaryDems in requesting a modest postponement so I had adequate time to review his full record – that was also denied. My decision is based on:  1) his judicial track record 2) his equivocation on whether presidents should be investigated while in office, even though he investigated President Bill Clinton for Independent Counsel Ken Starr, and 3) what little we have seen of his White House record Based on what I heard — and didn't hear — from Judge #Kavanaugh at his hearings, and having reviewed his writings and record as a judge, I believe any reasonable person would have cause to be concerned, even fearful, of his confirmation to the Supreme Court.  I will vote no. My friend @SenJohnMcCain understood better than most the importance of NATO to U.S. national security. Absolutely fitting for the new NATO headquarters to be named in his honor, as NATO continues to defend our values and push back against Russia's malign behavior. … CSPAN has posted the entire nearly 8-minute exchange between Kamala Harris and Kavanaugh on the Mueller probe.

He simply interprets them. So why wouldn't he commit to upholding protections for people with #PreExistingConditions? Those protections are part of the #ACA – a law, written by Congress. When asked if the President of the United States must abide by a subpoena, #Kavanaugh replied, "you're asking me to give an answer to a hypothetical," which he "cannot do."  Judge Kavanaugh: you spent 3 years working for Ken Starr. This isn't hypothetical. Stop equivocating. .@SenFeinstein asked a critical constitutional question: Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?   @realDonaldTrump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Kavanaugh, refused to give a straight answer.  That is incredibly troubling.pic.twitter.com/KczwfYZEEW Jailed for reporting on the genocide being committed against the #Rohingya people. Outrageous. Let these courageous journalists be a reminder of the importance of a free press, and let our voices join the chorus of those demanding their immediate, unconditional release. … .@SenateGOP keeps saying we must "respect the process" – I agree.  Demanding transparency and access to Judge #Kavanaugh’s complete record is precisely what "respecting the process" looks like. Republicans claim they reviewed 42 THOUSAND new pages of Judge Kavanaugh’s records overnight.   .@SenWhitehouse: For the record, that’s a rate of 7,000 pages per hour. That’s superhuman.pic.twitter.com/QX4ShO1ReH But now – when 42,000 documents were just delivered last night, and tens of thousands more remain hidden by "executive privilege" – now they’re suddenly in a rush? Rarely has hypocrisy been so transparent. #Kavanaugh My @JudiciaryDems colleagues are right. Today's #Kavanaugh hearing should have been postponed until they were given access to his full record.  @SenateGOP allowed a Supreme Court vacancy to continue for nearly a year when they refused to even grant Merrick Garland a hearing... Dick Durbin: "We waited for more than year with a vacancy on the Supreme Court under the direction of your leader in the U.S. Senate ... That we cannot take a few days or weeks to have a complete review of Judge Kavanaugh's record is unfair to the American people." (via ABC)pic.twitter.com/4UFU6UeIMY This #LaborDay I want federal workers, educators, factory workers and all workers to know: I stand with you. @POTUS' ongoing attacks on unions & worker protections run counter to our values and all that's made our economy strong. We must and we WILL stand united in opposing them. Wishing all the hardworking men and women of this country, and the unions who fight for their interests, a happy #LaborDay. American workers built this nation. Let today be a reminder that we owe them the fair wages, benefits, job training and quality #healthcare they've earned. This week, @BetsyDeVosED sided against the rights of sexual assault victims, student loan borrowers defrauded by for-profit schools, and educators by proposing federal education dollars be used to purchase guns for classrooms. I will not allow these policies to go unchallenged. The Secretary of Education is supposed to promote students’ health and safety. Utterly disheartening to see @BetsyDeVosED consistently turn her back against those she should protect. … Devastating.  @POTUS: We will not forget about these children. We will not let this go.

These are patriots, @POTUS, and they deserve better. Zero. This seems to be how much respect @POTUS has for federal workers.  It's outrageous and hypocritical that after spending billions of dollars on the #GOPTaxScam, suddenly the White House says there's no money for a minimal cost-of-living adjustment for our public servants. … @SenatorCardin on this just now: “It is outrageous and hypocritical that after spending billions of taxpayer dollars on tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations … that suddenly The White House finds that there is zero money left to pay a minimal cost-of-living adjustment.” … I call on @BetsyDeVosED to abandon her reckless, absurd plan to use federal funds to arm teachers.

For nearly a dozen years in the Senate, John McCain has been my friend and enduring partner in standing up for universal human rights &advancing core American values.

His death is a great loss for this country, his family and friends. My deepest sympathies &condolences are with Cindy, their children &family at this difficult time. Congress should move to block this dangerous proposal by Secretary @BetsyDeVosED immediately. School districts like @BaltCitySchools need funds to purchase supplies, promote college and career fairs, and provide training for counselors. Not to buy guns. … Absolutely agree with @JudiciaryDems on the need to postpone #Kavanaugh hearing. Too much is at stake to rush through this critical life-time appointment. … Third: our educators are exactly that – educators. A difficult enough job as it stands. They do not want guns in their classrooms, making the job exponentially more difficult and dangerous. This proposal would ignore that reality, which is precisely why I'll fight it. #GunSafety Second: as Maryland educators prepare to head back to school, 91% will use their own money to purchase supplies for their classrooms. They need resources to support struggling students and address mental health needs – not firearms to protect from imaginary grizzly bear attacks. Thread.  This is reckless and absurd, @BetsyDeVosED. First: Maryland law already requires school districts to provide a trained school resource officer to ensure school safety. #GunSafety … Today I led @EPWDems in demanding documents from Brett Kavanaugh’s time in the White House pertaining to his environmental record.

It's time we act like it. … The identification of @POTUS as an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal scheme is more than sufficient cause for Congress to immediately pass legislation protecting the Mueller investigation. I'm calling on my colleagues, on both sides, to join me in passing it. Now. We already know that Judge Kavanaugh has dangerous views about presidential power. But Republicans don’t want the public to see the vast majority of documents from his time in the White House. What are they trying to hide?pic.twitter.com/S3XfkeVRpt We needed to push back on the outrageous price increases caused by @POTUS' deliberate steps to undercut our health insurance markets and choke off federal funding. @POTUS promised to lower #healthcare costs, but nearly every action he has taken while in office has raised them. Together, we are working to stabilize the insurance market for Marylanders. But the reality is this waiver would not have been necessary if not for the Trump Administration's ongoing sabotage of the #ACA.

This cycle must end, and it must end with us. I want to thank Anne Arundel County Police and all the first responders who rushed headlong into danger to save others' lives yesterday.

He should also honor American values by putting an end to his gratuitous praise of Kim Jong Un, a brutal and violent dictator. #NorthKoreaSummit Any path forward from here must entail #NorthKorea making a complete declaration of their nuclear programs, verifying that those programs are frozen, allowing international inspectors to see exactly what is going on, and agreeing to the removal of nuclear weapons and materials.

This is a debate of whether we are on the side of big utility-type companies or individuals and small businesses to guarantee them equal access to this critical service. Almost half of consumers have no choice of ISP. This is not about competition but preventing discrimination.

Let us express our gratitude by resisting the reemergence of nationalist and racist influences, and by holding today's authoritarians accountable. #DDaypic.twitter.com/E8GEGjf6sZ The Equal Rights Amendment would provide a constitutional basis for claims of gender-based violence, and give Congress the constitutional basis to pass a law giving women victimized by gender-based violence legal recourse in federal courts.

The Equal Rights Amendment is barely longer than a tweet, but would finally, expressly prohibit gender-based discrimination in our Constitution – and that’s long overdue. #ERANow … .@POTUS' claim that Democrats are responsible for children being separated from their families at the border is not based in any reality. Make no mistake: the president alone is responsible for this inhumane policy, and it's entirely within his power to fix it. … Maryland, today is the last day to register to #vote online before the primary on June 26.

To add clarity at the federal level, Congress should pass the Equality Act. Every American deserves the same freedoms and same protections under the law. Today #SCOTUS made it clear that LGBT individuals should not be discriminated against or face ‘indignities,’ as described by Justice Kennedy, ‘when they seek goods and services in an open market.' #OpenToAll … Sorry @POTUS , in the United States of America, no one - not even the president - is above the law. … I support universal background checks for all firearms purchases.  An overwhelming majority of Americans – Democrats, Republicans, NRA members and others – support some kind of expanded background checks. … The safety of our children and communities should never be put at risk by partisan gridlock. It is outrageous that the Senate cannot come together on common sense gun safety legislation despite public support for so many of these measures.  #WearOrangepic.twitter.com/gx7H4eOlsU Good question!

The future of MD's coastal communities depend on #climateaction. @POTUS decision, one year ago today, to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement put America alone and America last. Rather than steamrolling our allies and major trading partners, let’s see some diplomacy and real negotiating toward trade relationships that do not upend the global economy - especially the American economy. What’s lacking in all this bluster is a rational strategy. If there is one, I urge the president to share it with the American people. We need a long-term plan to tackle our economic challenges and protect American workers. … The fight for equality has gained momentum, thanks to Illinois! … The 27th Amendment, which prohibited immediate congressional pay raises, was ratified after 203 years. There should be no deadline keeping America from recognizing women as equals under the law. Most Americans are shocked to find out that the U.S. Constitution still lacks a provision ensuring gender equality. It's long past time to recognize the equality of women in the foundation document for U.S. law. Thank you, Illinois!  We need just ONE more state to ratify and we need Congress to do its part by passing S.J.Res. 5, which would immediately remove the arbitrary and unnecessary deadline for states to ratify the #ERA. … Tonight I had the chance to thank the first responders who ran toward danger during the #ECFlood.

Remarkable this is happening once again.pic.twitter.com/Z6Q7yzPu95 On this #MemorialDay18, we are reminded that many heroes never stop serving our communities after their enlistments end. … As I pray for the families of our fallen this weekend, I will also pray for our men and women currently serving at home and abroad along with their families. I am grateful for those who have served our country past and present and I will continue to do my very best to serve them. One of the best ways to honor our fallen heroes is for us to work together to defend our freedom and our American principles. We cannot allow the erosion of the liberties our friends and neighbors have fought so hard to defend. They and those like them deserve every honor we can bestow.          As we consider the cost of our freedom, let us also remember the families of our fallen, our Gold Star families. We recognize the tremendous loss to these great American families and admire their patriotism. I remember the sacrifices of my fellow citizens from MD like those of Specialist Tocarra Green during this time. She was the 1st woman from MD to die in the Iraq War. I remember Sergeant Erick M. Houck, a Baltimore native like me, who died in Afghanistan just last year. Across our proud nation this #MemorialDay2018 , we remember the men and women of our Armed Forces who made the greatest sacrifice imaginable. Whether on the battlefield of Antietam, the beaches of Normandy or in the mountains of Afghanistan, we pay honor to their immense courage. Heartbroken to see flooding again devastate @EllicottCity Main Street. Please respect the directives of emergency personnel and the power of floodwaters. My prayers tonight are with local residents and our first responders. The President’s hostility to public servants is both mean-spirited and wrong for our country.  As my revered colleague Pat Moynihan often said, ‘If you have contempt for government, you will get contemptible government. … I’ve written to Secretary #DeVos to ensure that the Dept of Education maintains its commitment to students and investigates colleges that enrich for-profit school execs at the expense of taxpayers.  … Outrageous. Secretary #DeVos hired for-profit school execs and w/in months the special unit designed to protect students shuttered investigations into 3 for-profit schools. Now they have only 3 staffers to oversee fraud at nearly 6,900 colleges. Draining the swamp? Not. Our students deserve better. Hiring for-profit school executives to oversee the unit investigating for-profit schools creates clear and direct conflicts of interest. And it’s no way to run the Department of Education. … This country stands for the constitutional protections of the First Amendment – the right of freedom of speech. That's what this country is about. I share the NFL players’ concerns about civil rights in America and I support their First Amendment rights to express themselves.pic.twitter.com/Jl6nLSRdtI I ask my colleagues to keep the family and colleagues of Officer Caprio in their thoughts and prayers. … Thoughts about @BaltimoreCoMD police Officer Amy Caprio, the first female officer killed in the line of duty for the county. This loss has shaken the community. She was dedicated and had an incredible future ahead of her. #endofwatch  … Agree!  And it's good to see you on the floor again. #TeamMaryland … Access to family planning services is one of the best tools we have to prevent abortions. While I have little faith in Republican leadership to stand up against @realDonaldTrump on behalf of the women of America, I urge them to help us block this policy from ever being enacted. It is appalling that @POTUS continues this relentless assault on women’s health. He fails to see that every move he makes to deny women low-cost, accessible health care options simply to placate his political patrons only puts the lives of women and children at great risk.#TitleX This is what a real commitment to our teachers and school buildings looks like.

Maryland has not forgotten. This flooding illustrates the importance of the $225 million I secured for sewer overflow control in this year's #WRDA bill. Those funds will help communities construct separate rain water and sewage water systems, so people can keep using their water even during bad rainstorms. … I'm continuing to monitor the devastating flooding around Frederick and the Eastern Shore, and encourage residents to stay off the roads unless strictly necessary. Marylanders everywhere should listen closely to their local alert systems and follow @MDMEMA for updates. These remarks are inexcusable. No one, least of all the President of the United States, should engage in such hateful, dehumanizing language. That isn't a high bar. It's disturbing that @POTUS cannot seem to meet it. … I'm proud to report the Senate just voted to restore #NetNeutrality. This is big. And it's thanks to you.

For those who already have – there's a fast, easy way to check on the status of your return right here:   #TaxDay … The question must be asked again: why is President Trump himself so reluctant to hold Putin accountable for his attacks on democracy and his support for Assad?

I join in commemorating them, in remembering the victims, and I pledge to do my part to ensure we keep our promise of #NeverAgain. On Yom HaShoah, we remember the atrocities of the Holocaust so that we can ensure they never happen again. Today we remind ourselves of the mayhem that can occur when hatred and discord prevail – when fear is allowed to fester into division. #HolocaustRemembranceDay #NeverAgainpic.twitter.com/p0R5HnV5Jj In reply to my questioning, Mr. Pompeo said "torture is illegal." I agree. But as Sec of State, how would he reconcile his past views & @POTUS' sentiments on torture, which in 2016 included, “I would bring back a lot worse than waterboarding”? Will he stand up to the president? Director Pompeo characterizes @POTUS’ response to Russia's interference in our democracy as "robust." Wildly inaccurate until President Trump imposes all of the legally required sanctions on Putin and actually musters the courage to SAY the Kremlin is a threat. One of my concerns regarding Director Pompeo's nomination for Secretary of State is how – in an administration that is so erratic and philosophically unmoored – he plans to promote human rights & democracy around the world.

RT if you think it's time to #ProtectMueller.pic.twitter.com/1dPq2s9D64 Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein oversees Special Counsel Mueller's investigation.

Any platform serious about protecting their users and theirs users' privacy should be implementing all four recommendations immediately, if they have not already. In January, I released a report detailing Putin's decades-long attack on democracy & included steps social media platforms should take:  -make political advertising transparent -audit election period interference -convene civil society advisory councils  -block malicious accounts Regarding Mr. #Zuckerberg's testimony today: I remain deeply unsettled that such a massive breach of privacy not only occurred, but was exploited for political ends, all without millions of users' knowledge. This cannot be allowed to happen again. If we closed the gender wage gap, we'd cut the poverty rate for working women in half and add nearly a half trillion dollars to our economy. Economically, socially, morally — any way you slice it, closing the gap makes sense and is the right thing to do. Full stop. #EqualPayDay #EqualPayDay reminds us that the gender pay gap isn't a women's problem, it's a national problem. No state, family or industry is immune. That's why I support the #PaycheckFairnessAct — because this problem is pervasive, and needs to be tackled head-on. … Across America, hardworking women and their families deserve equal pay for equal work. #EqualPayDaypic.twitter.com/STeuTW9cfc In honor of #EqualPayDay, a few infuriating facts:   On average women are paid just 80 cents for every dollar paid to a man.  Black women are paid 63 cents for every dollar.  Latinas are paid 54 cents. #EqualPayDay marks the day the average woman must work in order to catch up with what her white male colleague made in the previous year—and for women of color, that wage gap is even wider. … In 2018, on average women still only earn 80 cents to every dollar earned by their white male colleagues, and that figure is even less for many women of color #EqualPayDaypic.twitter.com/vuNsXqQpxg I'm live with my colleagues right now to discuss our efforts to block this Administration's rolling back of strong fuel economy standards.

An incredible achievement that truly showcases the hard work of students from both schools. I'll be watching the live-stream and cheering you on. #HCASC Given how long it took @POTUS to set these sanctions into motion, it is not credible to believe he led the decision-making process here. Still, this is the clearest signal the White House has sent yet that Russia must be held accountable for its malign, destabilizing activities. … It's been 9 months since Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass additional sanctions on Russia for its interference in our elections. It's clear @POTUS himself has little interest in enforcing those sanctions.

In reality, this does nothing but help Big Oil at the expense of middle income Americans who will keep leaving more of their hard-earned paychecks behind at the pump. … It may be impossible to overstate how short-sighted and foolish this is.

Congress cannot wait for the courts to decide their fate. We must act. We must pass a #DreamActNow. Tomorrow is the deadline @POTUS imposed on #DACA, when thousands lose their legal status.   I haven't forgotten. The courts may still be hearing the issue, effectively delaying the deadline. But Congress must still act. Dreamers are living in limbo & that is wholly unacceptable. The fact that heavily trained New York City police officers are only able to hit their targets 18% of the time during active shooter situations should forever end the debate on arming school teachers. #GunSafety … #ReadAcrossAmericaDay is also Dr. Seuss' birthday. So today, I am reminded of one of my favorite Dr. Seuss quotes from one of his best books.  You. Me. All of us together – we must continue to care about each other and the world around us.

My hope is that more will listen. … .@POTUS claims over and over that he wants to help strengthen our economy & create jobs, yet he simultaneously seeks to eliminate critical federal investments that allow Chesapeake Bay states like Maryland to prosper. Congress must reject this #budget. … Once again, @POTUS has ignored the bipartisan support in Congress for a strong, well-funded effort to protect the #ChesapeakeBay – something absolutely vital to our state economy. Congress must reject this budget proposal, just as we rejected last year's. … This is why I introduced legislation banning federal funds from being used on a #MilitaryParade. $10 to $30 million? There are much more effective ways to use those tax dollars on our brave troops. They need training, resources, health care. Not parades. … I'm not giving up on protecting #Dreamers and #TPS recipients until the job is done. They do not deserve to live in a constant state of uncertainty, and I'm going to keep fighting to ensure they don't have to. I call on my colleagues to do the same. #DreamActNow #SaveTPS I was bitterly disappointed by failure to pass legislation protecting #Dreamers this week. This crisis was created by @POTUS when he upended #DACA and put an expiration date on their backs, and he has continued to upend bipartisan deals to fix it. Still, this fight is not over. The indictments announced today run parallel to the Senate Foreign Relations report I released in January detailing Vladimir Putin's nearly two-decade long assault on democratic institutions. @POTUS must use every tool available to seek justice on behalf of the American people.pic.twitter.com/tDoGqrC1Sy It is now long past time for @POTUS to admit that the Russian effort to interfere in our elections was no "hoax." America has been left vulnerable to malign Russian efforts because he has put himself above the security of our nation.

And their lives are in jeopardy. So I'm not giving up. @SenateDems and I are going to keep fighting for #Dreamers until the job is done, with or without the president's help. I am bitterly disappointed by today's failure to pass legislation protecting #Dreamers. By threatening to veto bipartisan legislation, @POTUS – once again – poisoned good-faith bipartisan negotiations and made it impossible to find a viable compromise. But this fight is not over. Lots of people lamenting "nothing will change" today.   That's what people said before the Montgomery boycott.   That's what people said before Stonewall.   Change happens, if at the moment when it seems most unlikely, you decide to do more.  #Parkland Horrified. My heart is with Florida tonight. It's an outrage that gun violence has reached our children yet again, in a place where they should feel safest: their school. I'm praying for the victims and their families, though I know our prayers will not be enough. Fact 5: #TPS recipients are the parents of more than 190,000 U.S. citizen children, who were born here, raised here and go to school here. Forcing legal TPS immigrants to now leave the country would tear those families apart.   And that's just not who we are as a nation. #SaveTPS Fact 4: #TPS recipients have been here working, paying taxes and contributing to our economy for years. Many have been living here for decades.   Losing them would cost the U.S. an estimated $164 billion in Gross Domestic Product over 10 years. #SaveTPS Fact 3: The layoffs of 250,000 #TPS holders currently employed would cost their employers – U.S. businesses, many of them our neighborhood small businesses – nearly $1 billion in immediate turnover costs. Fact 2: Because so many are homeowners, kicking out #TPS recipients could destabilize U.S. housing markets as 60,000 mortgages would be put at risk. This week, it's more important than ever that we speak openly – and factually – about #immigration. Let's start with the #TPS program.  Fact 1: TPS recipients are legal immigrants. They came here legally, seeking refuge from tragedy. Now, 1/3 of them are U.S. homeowners. #SaveTPS Thank you, @SenAlexander, for leading the resolution commemorating this historic moment in the civil rights movement, and to @DougJones and @SenBobCorker for co-sponsoring it alongside me. This is a story that deserves to be heard, remembered and passed down. #BlackHistoryMonth … This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Memphis sanitation workers strike – a pivotal moment in America's fight for civil rights. It's a story that speaks to the intersection of economic & racial equality, and it's a story that deserves to be passed down to future generations … $240 billion in infrastructure spending is eliminated, reducing budgets in every category: from roads, bridges, ports, to transit, water & wastewater.  It's clear that infrastructure joins the long list of issues for which @POTUS has no desire to be a serious negotiating partner. .@POTUS' charade of an #infrastructure plan is a ruse.   It guts core environmental laws that protect public health, goes back on his promise to buy/hire American by gutting protections for workers, and astoundingly, actually cuts more in infrastructure spending than it adds. Trump’s long-awaited infrastructure plan is a fraud  Particularly pernicious is this idea that it's a 1.5 trillion plan.   It's a $200 billion plan, offset by $200 billion in cuts elsewhere  It's a ZERO DOLLAR infrastructure plan  Talking small biz success - MD's growth engine - w/ Del.

Yet @POTUS chooses to believe Mr. Putin.  Thank you to @SenBlumenthal, @ChrisVanHollen and @SenDuckworth for co-sponsoring my bill prohibiting federal funds from being used on a military parade. They know, as I do, that there are much better ways to honor our brave troops besides wasting millions on a parade. We have the best armed forces in the world. We don't need to flex our muscle to showcase military hardware. Our strength is demonstrated every day around the world by the brave men & women of our military.  And there are much more effective ways of honoring them than a parade. I've introduced a bill prohibiting federal funds from being used on a military parade, and call on my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me.  We should honor our troops by giving them the training & resources they need.

The Turkish government must take immediate action to restore confidence in the independence of its judiciary. The opioid epidemic, Alzheimer's, brain cancer, antibiotic resistant bacteria – we must invest in these health crises, including by investing in @NIH.  Our research institutions are world class; they can save lives if we give them the resources. This #BudgetDeal does. The bipartisan #BudgetDeal will also substantially increase federal support for the #OpioidEpidemic, which has destroyed too many lives. We need to invest in prevention, treatment, and recovery. This budget finally does that. The #BudgetDeal @SenateDems struck is imperfect, but I'm pleased we successfully negotiated much for middle income families. We expanded funding for community health centers, closed #Medicare's donut hole, invested more into child care & funded much-needed infrastructure projects I supported the #BudgetDeal because there's no such thing as a "good shutdown," and it was urgent that we fund key priorities. I'm pleased the Senate will now turn to immigration reform; we must roll up our sleeves and finally get the job done, with or without @POTUS' help.pic.twitter.com/qQ4Gc566v1 We have the best armed forces in the world.

It puts life-saving #healthcare out of reach for the world's most vulnerable, including millions of women and girls. One year later, @realDonaldTrump’s #GlobalGagRule is making it increasingly difficult for international groups to provide treatment for HIV/AIDS and other diseases.

Now let's try for a qualified nominee who believes in science and values science over politics to make policy decisions. … On Thursday, we hit the government's funding deadline. Again.  Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. I hope they understand we cannot govern -- and our military & federal agencies cannot effectively do their jobs -- with continuing resolutions. We need a #budget. There are useful and important ways we could be spending $25 billion. A #BorderWall is not one of them. It would do nothing to address the core problems with our immigration system, making it fundamentally ineffective and a waste of taxpayers' money.  Let's do better. Also #BetterThanAWall: Providing broadband to more Americans. $5 billion would provide high speed internet access to more than 2,000 rural communities that are currently underserved. Today, internet access is critical for finding employment, going to school and staying connected. More ideas: Infrastructure. $25 billion would reduce our bridge backlog by 20%, increasing safety and efficiency on our roadways nationwide, all while creating 325,000 jobs.  $25 billion would also reduce the public transit repair backlog by nearly 1/3. #BetterThanAWall More ideas for how we could spend $25 billion, besides on a futile #BorderWall:  Veterans. $25 billion would cover much of what's needed over the next decade to repair, upgrade, and meet safety standards at our VA hospitals, and close critical gaps in the VA's #healthcare system. Agree. … ... the president continues to do all he can to marginalize the rule of law and the independence of the Justice Department, while crippling the intelligence and law enforcement professionals who work tirelessly to keep our country safe. No one should be confused about what happened today: the president, once again, chose politics over national security. For the sake of our republic, a bipartisan majority of Congress must step up and put an end to this dangerous pattern of behavior. #NunesMemopic.twitter.com/lZas5ySh9r The investigators are the rank and file. You appointed the leadership. … These are just a few of the ways $25 billion would be better spent. These are just a few ways we can make our country safer and stronger. Using young #Dreamers' lives as leverage to waste billions of taxpayer dollars on a futile border wall is not one of them. $7 billion would ensure that all 1.16 million firefighters across the U.S. have breathing apparatus gear, potentially saving our first responders' lives as they work so hard to save ours. Currently, half of our country's fire departments cannot equip every firefighter on a shift. $25 million would establish 10 more state drug task forces to stop heroin traffickers. 80% of heroin seized last year was at ports of entry, so a #BorderWall won't solve our #OpioidEpidemic – but more manpower & technology at our ports could have a real, dramatic, positive effect $25 billion would eliminate the current backlog of 1,400 toxic and hazardous Superfund sites located in every state in the country. $25 billion would fund 11,000 water projects to repair and upgrade our crumbling drinking water and sewer systems nationwide – creating more than 500,000 new construction jobs in the process. #NoWall THREAD: President Trump's #BorderWall would cost American taxpayers $25 billion – yes, that's billion, with a "b." And it would not fix our broken immigration system, it would not make us safer, it would not make America stronger.  But I have some ideas for what would. Deeply disappointed w/passage of the new Polish law that may impede research, scholarship, journalism — and more — on the Holocaust. This absolutely is the wrong way to reach the supposed goal of "more accurate statements about the Holocaust." It used to be that Democrats and Republicans worked together to protect the independence of institutions like @TheJusticeDept and @FBI; to protect the rule of law in this country. Now it seems Republicans are willing to compromise that in order to protect @POTUS.pic.twitter.com/4yysjFNLZD Something else @POTUS failed to mention: he was the one who created this #DACADeal crisis by putting an expiration date on #Dreamers' backs. Now he wants to use Dreamers' lives as leverage to fund a futile border wall – and is asking American taxpayers to foot the bill. #SOTU Something missing from the president's #SOTU address last night: any mention of #Russia interfering in our elections, or the #RussianSanctions he is failing to enforce despite them having passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support.pic.twitter.com/g4k6wTrtrj Saddened by this tragic loss of life.

Extending the life of detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay is damaging to our national security. #GTMO #SOTU As President Reagan said, "a hungry child knows no politics". Successful U.S. international development efforts that improve quality of life and self-sufficiency and turn enemies into friends make the world safer and more stable and are central to U.S. national security." #sotu Reality: Our union endures, but America’s standing is diminished in the eyes of the world because of @POTUS brazen attempts to shut our doors and marginalize the compassion and opportunity that America has symbolized for generations. #SOTU How do US development dollars strengthen national security: alleviating poverty, improving global health and creating economic opportunities throughout the developing world effectively minimizes extremists influence and narrows the opportunities for our adversaries. #SOTU Rolling back rules that are meant to protect public health, clean air, clean water and the environment is not an accomplishment.

It denigrated our core values as a melting pot, and isolated us from the rest of the world. We cannot become desensitized to how unacceptable that is. Today marks one year since @POTUS' #MuslimBan, a shameful attempt to discriminate against Muslim immigrants. It exposed the fear, insecurity and even xenophobia that have come to define this Administration. Our response to it, as Americans, will define us. The lessons of the Holocaust rightly serve as warning signs to us today. We must never forget how quickly fear, hate and the normalization of bigotry became the rules that governed a nation. It is our responsibility to uphold our vow of "Never Again." #HolocaustRemembranceDay On this #HolocaustRemembranceDay, I join the global community in remembering the 6 million Jews who perished in the Holocaust.

Special Counsel Mueller's investigation must stay independent and free from interference by the President of the United States – that's critical to our very rule of law, and no one is above the law. … Congress' role in shaping U.S. foreign policy has never been more important. I will continue to advance legislation, conduct oversight & speak out about these issues in the name of the American people and the values that define us, so that we do not become #AmericaAlone. The U.S. military is the finest in the world, but increasingly President Trump wants our men and women in uniform to do what should be the responsibility of our diplomatic and development corps: be our force for peace. Besides the nuclear crisis w/ North Korea, nowhere have @POTUS' statements been more damaging than in our tenuous relationship with Russia. His words & actions have sent a clear signal to Vladimir Putin that attacks on our democratic institutions can be carried out with impunity Today I spoke on the Senate floor, looking back at the Trump Administration's first year and how @POTUS' "America First" strategy has proven both risky and chaotic.   Ultimately, #AmericaFirst First will lead to #AmericaAlone.  Watch here: … Absolutely outraged by this ISIS attack against @SavetheChildren in Afghanistan. My heart and deepest condolences go out to the victims and their families. Humanitarian aid workers should never be a target. This was an act of cowardice. #NotATarget … Gun violence is never more appalling than when it reaches our children. This is unacceptable. I grieve with all of Kentucky, and I'm praying for the families of those lost. … For the sake of our military and civilian workforce, as well as all those depending on government services, I'm glad we've reopened the government. But I'm determined to hold @SenateMajLdr to his word that we will get an immigration reform bill to the Senate floor. #DreamActNowpic.twitter.com/tDOY27Dnlx Democrats never wanted a shutdown, even for a few days. But we needed to take a stand to keep this budget can from being kicked down the road again and again – and to ensure GOP leadership committed to addressing all our nation's priorities. Especially protections for #Dreamers. For Marylanders who work for or support the federal government, including our military personnel, the frustration of a shutdown hit hard. There is no such thing as a ‘good shutdown,’ as the president characterized it. These public servants represent the best of America Leader McConnell will be held to his word that we will have a spending bill that addresses both defense and non-defense priorities, along with a fair opportunity to pass immigration reform. #DACADreamers Democrats never wanted to see the federal government #shutdown - even for a few days - but we needed to take a stand to keep this budget can from being kicked down the road again and again and again … The DREAMer issue is urgent. Many lives have been affected because @POTUS unnecessarily put a deadline on the program. We will hold @SenateMajLdr to his public word that we have a timeline to bring up this bill that has strong bipartisan support.  … We've accelerated by two weeks the deadline to get a budget done. We can't keep running the government on continuing resolutions. More live on the Senate floor now:  … No one wants a shutdown. Democrats want to keep govt open. We've tried. We have had unanimous consent requests rejected by the Republicans. We want to make sure everyone gets paid - military & civilian. That's also been rejected. We need a budget. #TrumpShutdownpic.twitter.com/5f5y8HNJkv The federal government can’t operate with continuing resolutions ... We could have four weeks kicking the can down the road, it’s not going to help anyone … . @SenatorCardin will join us in a few minutes to discuss the government shutdown. Listen on WBAL 1090 AM or here:  Early this morning, @clairecmc tried to pass a bill to guarantee military pay and death benefits in the #TrumpShutdown.  Republican Leader Mitch McConnell: I object. WATCH:pic.twitter.com/n3a7RBaxzi  … At its core, this battle is over a budget for our country. It hurts our military and our whole nation when we try to govern thru repeated continuing resolutions. We need a real budget that works for ALL our communities. There is #nosuchthingasagoodshutdown We're marching, hon. #BaltimoreWomensMarchpic.twitter.com/9wa2LgVQ0x The leadership vacuum in the White House has spilled over to congressional Republicans, forcing a shutdown of essential services that the American people rely on every day in every state across the nation. #TrumpShutdownpic.twitter.com/bh1zbcIbCE -Children who depend on #CHIP for health care -Federal workers -#Dreamers -Victims of the opioid epidemic  -Military & defense personnel   These are just some of the Americans counting on us to get this #BudgetDeal done. Days ago we had a bipartisan deal – @POTUS should honor it. Bottom line: we need to negotiate in good faith, keep the government open, and make the decisions we were sent here to make – now. #shutdown  Sen. Ben Cardin on whether there are enough Democratic votes for a delay to avert a shutdown: “I think so”  The violence against and pressure on Memorial Human Rights Center activists in #Russia must stop. The govt must prosecute arson attack on Nazran office and ensure the rights and safety of Oyub Titiev. I stand with @StateDept in calling for his release. … It's unconscionable that the party that controls the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the White House – the Republican Party – cannot pass a budget.  They seemingly cannot even honor a deal that had broad, bipartisan support and would have ensured we avoided a #shutdown. GOP leadership should have allowed amendments to make sure #FISA complies with the Constitution.  It is a falsehood to say that we must choose between protecting our national security and protecting the constitutional rights of American citizens. We can – and we must – do both. I voted against #FISA because the legislation did not strike the right balance between maintaining our national security and safeguarding the constitutional rights of American citizens. Senators should have had the opportunity to improve and amend this bill. I'm live with @BuzzFeedNews #AM2DM in just a few minutes. Looking forward to discussing the #RussiaReport I recently released and talking about what's happening in the Senate. Join me now:  A free press is no one's enemy. It is a bedrock pillar of democracy. If we fail to defend it, we fail to defend our rights as Americans – our right to be informed, to be critical, to have a transparent government.  These tenets have always, and must always, transcend politics. My letter to Sec. Tillerson and Admin Green speaks to what remains a critical issue that too many of our natl security institutions have been too slow to address: sexual harassment and its effects on the professionalism & effective functioning of those institutions. #MeTooNatSecpic.twitter.com/lVNrUtCs41 Industries are now reckoning with the ugly, troubling subjugation of women that has done so much harm. The US govt is unfortunately no different, and in our responsibility to oversee the @StateDept & @USAID, we must listen to women's voices and make dramatic changes. #MeTooNatSecpic.twitter.com/SvRpq3P9kJ Powerful action by American Jews and #Dreamers today. I stand with them in asking for a clean #DreamActNow. … Congress should give our intelligence agencies the tools they need to disrupt and prevent terrorist attacks. But we must simultaneously insist that any such awesome power comports with the U.S. Constitution and protects the civil liberties of innocent Americans. #FISApic.twitter.com/lkNTmi7YRf I just voted against cloture on reauthorizing #FISA because, particularly on a bill that has such a profound impact on the civil liberties of American citizens, Senators should have the opportunity to offer, debate, and vote on amendments.pic.twitter.com/ngnsCLhwpQ "This is not one person's country.

Today let us all pledge to follow his footsteps up that mountain. Let us pledge to carry on his dream until we meet him there. #MLKDay Dr. King lives on in every peacefully marching protester and every word spoken in opposition to injustice.

Join me in asking @SecretaryZinke to show MD the same respect & consideration shown to FL. #ProtectOurCoast … Just like Florida, Maryland has vibrant coastal communities and an economy that relies on the safety & health of our natural resources. I'm asking @SecretaryZinke to show MD the same respect & immediately exempt our coast from any new offshore oil or gas leases. #ProtectOurCoast … It’s almost a year under @POTUS and I can’t say anything he says stuns me anymore. His comments do not represent America’s values. This is very hurtful. … #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay is a critical reminder of the responsibility we have to the millions of children, women and men who have been coerced and exploited across the globe. We have a moral duty to be their voice. Silence is not an option. Inaction is not an option. WATCH: Full interview with @SenatorCardin @kwelkernbc @jmclaughlinSAIS on #AMR @MSNBC  Never before in American history has so clear a national security threat been so clearly ignored by a U.S. president. Without a strong U.S. response, elections here and abroad will remain vulnerable to the Kremlin's aggressive and sophisticated influence operations. #RussiaReport … Unfortunately, the one person in the U.S. government stopping a truly comprehensive U.S. government response is @POTUS. Never before in our history has so clear a threat to U.S. national security been so clearly ignored by the sitting president. #RussiaReport This threat existed long before Pres. Trump took office, and will exist after him unless he finally says ‘enough is enough’, acknowledges the threat, and leads our country and our allies in defending all that we care about. #RussiaReport This is the 1st U.S. government #RussiaReport to detail exactly how Putin operates, from a toolbox that includes military invasions, cyberattacks, disinformation, supporting fringe political groups, and weaponizing energy, crime & corruption. Summary here:  … Russia's attack on the U.S., while still being fully investigated, was not limited to email hacks or one election. The scale and scope of this threat is real, it is growing, and if left unchecked, it will happen again in 2018 and 2020. #RussiaReportpic.twitter.com/MoToBWptFg Today I'm releasing a #RussiaReport documenting Vladimir Putin's 20-year attack on democratic institutions in his own country and Europe. To protect against what the Kremlin did to the U.S. in 2016, we need to first understand Putin's pattern. … Reminder to tune in this morning to our event with Senator Cardin and Congressman Hurd as they discuss responses to Russia's foreign interference. Live streaming at   and  pic.twitter.com/htTrdojdvS Having Delaware’s neighboring Senator, @SenatorCardin, as a partner on EPW is a joy, but getting to work with both Maryland Senators to protect our shared backyard – and that of every American - is truly a gift. Glad to welcome @Chrisvanhollen to @EPWDems! … Important to note: the existing plan already allows for the leasing of more than 45 billion barrels of oil. Opening up more waters to drilling will do nothing more to secure our energy future, but could do tremendous damage to our economy & natural resources. #ProtectOurCoast I've joined dozens of my colleagues in sharply rebuking the Trump Administration for moving to open up a record percentage of federal waters to #OffshoreDrilling. It's both irresponsible and completely unnecessary. #ProtectOurCoastpic.twitter.com/LILh6iU41c The @FCC's decision to roll back #NetNeutrality was a transparent bow to corporate interests and a dangerous step toward suppressing the free flow of information online.

I'm proud to support it. … JUST IN: Senate bill to block FCC's net neutrality repeal now has 40 cosponsors  pic.twitter.com/slIJKme25Z Toria Nuland is a great choice for executing the sort of national security vision and strategic thinking our country needs. Congratulations to @CNASdc on securing such a tremendous asset. … .@SenatorCardin, @ChrisVanHollen and I have introduced legislation to provide permanent protection from deportation to individuals with TPS. Congress must move it! #SaveTPS … Moving. Empowering. Worth watching. If you still haven't seen @Oprah's Golden Globes speech, take a minute. … In November I introduced a bill to #SaveTPS and create a pathway to permanent residency for Salvadorans and other legal immigrants.   I call on my colleagues to take up that legislation immediately. It's the right thing to do, and it's time to do it now. … These are legal immigrants. They came here seeking refuge from tragedy. Now, about 1/3 of them are U.S. homeowners. They are the parents of more than 190,000 U.S. born children. Forcing them to leave will tear apart & devastate American families.

Now the Trump Admin is needlessly placing countless East Coast communities, thriving local economies and invaluable natural resources at risk. I'm disgusted, and I'm urging @POTUS to reverse course. #ProtectOurCoastspic.twitter.com/RNz8SEdCq2 This week @POTUS moved to allow offshore drilling along the East Coast.

I’ll fight to make sure that happens. #ACA Despite a shortened enrollment period and complete lack of support from @POTUS, Maryland's health insurance exchange successfully enrolled 153,571 people for 2018 #healthcare plans.   Our uninsured rate is now at 6.1% – a historic low. That's worth celebrating. #ACA #ThanksObama … This Administration's actions are as ignorant of common sense and scientific realities as they are of the widespread public opposition to Atlantic #OffShoreDrilling. I urge @POTUS to reverse course. Immediately.pic.twitter.com/Up7PqvcrJd This is the type of publicly unsupported action we've seen time and again from this Interior Dept, which clearly places the wishes of oil, gas & coal executives above those of average Americans. I cannot condemn this maneuver to allow #OffshoreDrilling along the East Coast enough I'm disgusted – but not surprised – by this news. This comes only a week after @POTUS repealed safety regulations implemented by the Obama Admin to prevent another Deepwater Horizon disaster & it needlessly places countless coastal communities at extreme risk. #OffshoreDrilling … The Trump administration is poised to roll back offshore drilling regulations that were put in place after the worst oil spill in U.S. history  This so-called "election integrity" commission should never have been formed. I'm glad it's being dissolved.  I thank the civil rights groups & state governments who stood up to this Administration's attempt to legalize #VoterSuppression and purge eligible voters from the rolls. … There's an urgent need in this frigid cold in #Baltimore. At the federal level, I urge my Senate colleagues to enact legislation I support, the School Bldg Improvement Act (S.1674) that will provide funding for school repair, renovation, new construction. … Our children should not be forced to make do with public schools without working heating systems. They deserve modern learning environments conducive to a high-quality education. #Baltimore … Heartbroken. Team Cardin lost a valued member at far too early an age. Anne Irby was a kind soul who will be missed greatly by me and all who knew her. … I call on the Govt of Iran to respect the right of its citizens to peacefully protest.

That's not what America stands for. I've met with many #Dreamers in Maryland. Most have known no other country but the US. They should not be living in fear. We should not go home without helping them.  #DreamActNow  … Live on the Senate floor now. #Dreamers are part of this country. They are part of our future. They deserve our help now. We should not be going into recess without dealing with the problems the dreamers are facing.  … Along w/@SenJohnMcCain, I pushed for the Global #Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act last year b/c the US must lead the world in using the power of our financial & legal institutions to hold human rts abusers & corrupt individuals accountable … .@SenJohnMcCain & I asked @StateDept to investigate abuse of gay men in Chechnya and wider human rights violations in Russian North Caucasus. Pleased they took our advice in today’s #Magnitsky designations. … Good news for Baltimore.

A true victory for the citizens of Russia. … Tonight's #GOPTaxScam guts state and local income tax deductions, which more than 40 million households rely on to avoid being double-taxed. That's unconscionable. We must correct it. … Calling their tax bill the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct would have been false advertising. Thankfully the name became available in time for me to introduce my own bill that fits the name much better by restoring SALT.pic.twitter.com/uDgRsQkkjs We haven’t passed this bill yet and Republicans are already talking about how to correct their mistakes. This isn’t how we should legislate. Why are we trying to pass a bill we know is greatly flawed?   … This bill is an assault on Marylanders. The average taxpayer in Maryland is going to pay more taxes with the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes. #doubletaxing is unfair This tax bill is not good for America. This is not a tax cut for middle-income Americans, it’s a bill for mega corporations. Watch more now  … If you're still wondering who Republicans' #TaxReform plan is for, remember: it makes tax breaks for corporations permanent but sunsets cuts for middle-income families. In 10 years, working families will see additional hikes while corporations will still be protected. #GOPTaxScampic.twitter.com/10IMisp6X8 This #GOPTaxScam is a highly partisan bill that permanently cuts taxes for corporations at the expense of everyone else.

That's exactly what @SenateGOP argued in 2010 when Scott Brown was elected. We listened to our Republican colleagues then. They should listen to us now. … #CHIP must be fully funded. Now. We should all be working tirelessly to ensure that it is. We should all be able to agree that children – all children – deserve health care. #CHIP has long received bipartisan support, because members of both parties know millions of children will suffer without it. But this year, it's been an uphill battle. This year, it's being used as a bargaining tool for the @SenateGOP's agenda. Enough is enough. The Children's Health Insurance Program (#CHIP) provides health care for 9 million kids, most of whom would not receive the care they need otherwise. Millions of them battle chronic conditions.  Funding #CHIP should not be controversial or political. It should be a moral duty. … Looking forward to welcoming @GDouglasJones to the Senate!
