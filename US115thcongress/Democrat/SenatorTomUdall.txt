Honored to spend time with #NM Principal of the Year Dr. Warman Hall of Aztec HS & his wife Anjee.   He has been a beacon of strength for his students & faculty after last year's tragic AHS shooting. He exemplifies how hard educators work every day to support tomorrow’s leaders.pic.twitter.com/Lq6ZBjCL7S  … The Constitution requires @POTUS to seek congressional approval for war. This legislation will send a clear signal that Congress is re-asserting its Constitutional authority, ending the looming threat of war to make our nation, and the world, safer. The consequences of war with Iran would be catastrophic, risking countless lives, our national security & our international reputation. The only way to stop Iran’s dangerous behavior is with tough diplomacy in league with our allies, not threats & reckless aggression. The Trump administration is taking us down an all-too-familiar path toward war in the Middle East, this time with Iran. Today, I introduced legislation to stop @POTUS from launching an unconstitutional war against Iran without explicit authorization from Congress.pic.twitter.com/S1JELsa6Vi With multiple serious & deeply disturbing allegations now levied against Judge Kavanaugh, we must have— at a minimum— an immediate halt to these proceedings to allow for a full FBI background investigation, and for the Senate to hear from all relevant witnesses. With everything going on in our country, we can’t allow ourselves forget about these children. @POTUS is long overdue to fix the crisis he created. Because #FamiliesBelongTogether Almost 1 year since Trump admin. established their cruel #FamilySeparation policy.  2 months since the court-ordered deadline to reunite children & parents.  182 of those children STILL wondering if they’ll see their families again, w/ thousands more in detention. It's inhumane. This inflammatory and belligerent speech from Trump National Security Advisor Bolton is yet another reason why I’m introducing a bill tomorrow to make sure @POTUS doesn't go to war with Iran without Congressional approval. … Even after a court ordered them to ban chlorpyrifos, the Trump @EPA is pulling out all the stops to keep this toxic pesticide on your food & on the market. Yet again, this administration is working overtime for corporate allies, at the expense public health. #BanChlorpyrifospic.twitter.com/xj8kT5iWgf Living in a democracy means we have the opportunity–and the duty—to vote. It’s the best way to make your voice heard, but you have to register soon if you want to vote in November! These days, you can register online at   #NationalVoterRegistrationDaypic.twitter.com/ls7gX2f4OI More than a century later, the Trump admin. is launching illegal attacks on our national monuments, & on Teddy Roosevelt's legacy.   The DC Circuit Court will decide on @POTUS' illegal attacks. And let me be clear: only Congress has the authority to change a monument designation. On this day in 1906, Teddy Roosevelt designated the 1st National Monument. Today, #NM has 10 National Monuments of our own, each of which shows why we're the Land of Enchantment.   Let's follow in Teddy Roosevelt's footsteps— and protect our precious lands for future generations. Top foreign policy minds agree: @POTUS should stop threatening Iran with hostile rhetoric & try some diplomacy.   That's why I'm intro'ing legislation that reflects the Constitution: the Trump admin needs Congressional approval if they want war with Iran. … The Senate should halt all proceedings on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination until a full and independent background investigation has been conducted by the FBI into the serious allegations against him. It shouldn't be difficult to treat Dr. Ford with the respect and dignity she deserves. These attempts by Senate Republicans to pressure Dr. Ford and force through this nomination -- with callous ultimatums and arbitrary deadlines -- must stop. Saturday is #NationalPublicLandsDay, which means FREE entry to parks across the country. I encourage every #NewMexico family to take this opportunity to get outside and #FindYourPark:  pic.twitter.com/FJ2eh3Bnq8 Keeping victims of #Florence, their loved ones & brave first responders in my thoughts. I've been inspired by the stories of neighbors selflessly helping neighbors despite the storm's danger. Our darkest moments show us the true value of community. … In honor of #POWMIARecognitionDay, I’m reflecting on the heroes who were captured during war and the brave troops that never came home. They might not be here with us, but remain in our hearts and on our minds.   Your country remembers you today. You are not forgotten.pic.twitter.com/ITHFJ992b4 Sandia’s solar-powered balloon #tech that allows researchers to detect seismic activity from the air has been selected by @NASA for tests to advance future spaceflight   pic.twitter.com/FQpC8L6beS Senate GOP & @POTUS need to do right by Dr. Ford. Right now, they are sending the wrong message to women.   We must not contribute to the culture of fear. We must build a culture where women feel safe telling their stories. Bullying brave women who come forward does the opposite. Proud to intro #NativeAmericanSuicidePreventionAct w/@MartinHeinrich @SenWarren @lisamurkowski. Our response to the suicide crisis in Indian Country must reflect Native communities' unique needs. Together, we will strengthen our response to suicide & bring hope to those at-risk. The @SenateGOP is barreling forward with the #Kavanaugh nomination despite a deeply serious and troubling allegation, refusing to reopen the FBI background process or even call other witnesses at their rushed hearing. Women in New Mexico and around the country are watching.pic.twitter.com/7XlEJBbXDZ LISTEN LIVE: I’m joining Native America Calling (@180099native) at 11AM MDT/1PM ET to talk about why I’m voting NO on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination.   Let’s be clear: Maria was a tragedy. And the ensuing response—or lack thereof—was a travesty. 365 days later, our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico are STILL suffering on parts of the island. They need our full support. … On the one year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, I am keeping the families of those who lost loved ones — and those still working to recover — in my thoughts.   The Trump administration's response to Maria failed our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico. And we must do better. Flu season is upon us—that’s why I got my flu shot last week! Luckily, the #ACA ensures that everyone can get a flu vaccine. And @CDCgov makes that even easier with this resource that’ll show you where you can go to get the shot:  pic.twitter.com/OBAlANehGX Jill and I are wishing all who are observing #YomKippur a peaceful, easy fast. G'mar Chatimah Tovah.pic.twitter.com/NKVXwmWzBD Now here we have a victory for democracy and for the voice of the people. Every single American deserves to know when big money donors are trying to buy our elections — I'm determined to make that kind of transparency a reality. … Another day, another Trump admin giveaway to irresponsible polluters. @Interior’s repeal of @BLMnational's #MethaneRule w/o a public hearing hurts #NM public health & our climate. Once again, @POTUS ignores the people to give corporate polluters a boost. … Today we must celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument by fighting to protect it from real threats posed by the Trump administration. Let's pass #AntiquitiesActof2018 to preserve America's spectacular landscapes. #MonumentsForAllpic.twitter.com/4tzq9CoKRf 71 years ago, the @USAirForce was established.

This not only goes against our shared American values—it’s detrimental to our international relationships and just plain wrong. … Proud to vote for & pass legislation that combats the opioid epidemic with better prevention, treatment & recovery programs. I fought to include #NM & Indian Country priorities in this bill that will save lives & bring needed relief to our many communities ravaged by this crisis. .@NMSU was established 130 years ago— that’s 130 years of fostering bright young minds in #NM with their incredible research facilities & programs directed towards empowering underserved communities. I'm proud of the amazing work they’ve done & continue to do for our state. "Gag clauses" prevent pharmacists from telling patients about cheaper payment alternatives. That's not right, which is why I'm co-sponsoring a bill enabling pharmacies to give you that info. It's simple: a price tag should never get between you & the medicine you need. Dr. Ford’s allegation against Judge #Kavanaugh is disturbing & should be fully investigated by the FBI. @SenJudiciary should delay vote on his nomination until that investigation is complete & this serious allegation has been heard by the committee in the appropriate way.pic.twitter.com/5F5a0GuT5a Today, I wrote in @thenewmexican about the disturbing level of misunderstanding Judge #Kavanaugh has displayed about Native communities. It’s unbecoming of a #SCOTUS nominee, & that’s one of the reasons why I’m voting NO. … In honor of #HispanicHeritageMonth, we recognize the central role Hispanic & Latino communities have played in shaping #NM. Hispanic & Latino traditions, communities & leaders have enriched our state for generations—making #NM the vibrant, diverse place we're proud to call home.pic.twitter.com/07BvulK0NL For everyone hiking @BandelierNPS this weekend & throughout fall, keep a lookout for tarantulas—& please don’t harm them! Tarantulas have been around for >16 million years & are pretty easy-going critters. Here's a shot after we pulled over to let a wayward one cross the road:pic.twitter.com/hI0tywagtL Nothing should stand in the way of #NM children & their chance at success, especially not how much money their family makes or where they grow up.  That's why I support the Child Care for Working Families Act. It's time for #ChildCare4All.pic.twitter.com/1T0sh6w81P I'm so proud of that work, but we can do more when it comes to making sure the promise of #VAWA is fully realized for all women. #VAWA expires on Sept. 30, so we need to work hard for reauthorization while modernizing & strengthening it to protect the most vulnerable. 24 years ago #VAWA became law. Importantly, with each renewal of #VAWA, we've extended critical protections further— in 2013, we worked to get better protections for Native women, who are at far too high a risk of violence. A shameful new low: @POTUS is denying official reports that nearly 3,000 Americans died in #PuertoRico due to #HurricaneMaria. The Trump administration's response failed our fellow Americans & the president should take responsibility for the tragedy that occurred on his watch. … Bad: @Interior rolling back public health and enviro safeguards when leasing #publiclands for drilling and mining   Worse: Doing it without public input. New Mexicans have the right to make their voices heard when it comes to the use of NM's #publiclands. … The #EndangeredSpeciesAct is one of our most successful & popular laws. Today, I came together with @SenatorCarper, @RepRaulGrijalva, @RepDebDingell & @RepDonBeyer to tell @POTUS that we won't stand for his administration's attacks on our wildlife, ecosystems, or way of life.pic.twitter.com/uC5Y4EmWiK The #EndangeredSpeciesAct is in danger because of threats from @POTUS' admin.

As @IndianCommittee Vice Chair, I'm committed to defending the rights of indigenous people—and I'm voting NO on #Kavanaugh.pic.twitter.com/osOwyFXOmY Once again Trump's @EPA is putting polluters over people by weakening emission limits & endangering Americans’ health. It’s a disturbing pattern: this Environmental Protection Agency isn't interested in actually protecting the environment—or the people. … .@intel has been important to #NM's economy & Rio Rancho's community for 30+ years. It’s great to hear about the 100 new jobs they’re bringing to RR & better yet that they'll hire locally. It's a priority of mine to connect innovative businesses with #NM's dedicated workforce. I’m proud to lead a bipartisan coalition from NM, CO, & KS to preserve $50 million in federal funding to maintain Amtrak service on the Southwest Chief route. @SenatorTomUdall @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner @JerryMoran @SenPatRoberts & I will keep fighting for the Southwest Chief.pic.twitter.com/9KlxeoV71r Today, we set aside our differences to remember the tragic events of 9/11. Let us honor those we lost and pay tribute to the bravery of those who rushed into burning buildings to the aid of others. To those that lost loved ones, our nation stands with you—today & always.pic.twitter.com/sQvgbmCck5 Considering the sheer number of documents still being shielded from the Senate & the public, we may have only seen the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Judge Kavanaugh’s willful misunderstanding of the rights held by Native communities. Kavanaugh’s hearing underscored the danger his nomination poses to Indian Country. His position on the trust relationship between tribes and the United States gov't is dismissive, often outright hostile, and altogether runs against decades of precedent.pic.twitter.com/70ONBX7Uzx Jill and I wish a happy new year to all those celebrating #RoshHashanah in #NM and across the country! May you and your families have a happy, healthy and sweet New Year.pic.twitter.com/kO2BoiQMGd Proud to have been named to the committee that will finalize this year’s Interior & Environment funding legislation. I'm ready to fight for public lands, our environment & all of #NM's priorities as we put together this bill. Congrats, @AcomaPueblo, Mescalero Apache Tribe & @PojoaquePueblo on a total $129,000+ in well-deserved @natlparkservice grants.   It's vital that we make sure #NM tribes can access these resources, to sustain projects that preserve culture & history for generations to come. This funding bill is a win for #NM, investing in rural health initiatives, early childhood education, veterans employment & more. My priority as a member of @SenateApprops is devoting resources to programs that help #NM thrive—this bill does just that. … The Constitution requires the president to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” but instead @POTUS plans to DEFY the law to keep families in detention. What about his oath of office? Instead of ending the inhumane family separation crisis they created, @POTUS, @DHSgov & @HHSgov are busy finding ways to detain children & families indefinitely. … Native Hawaiians have a special trust relationship w/ the US— Judge #Kavanaugh’s failure to recognize that is another reason why I am voting NO. I believe his record shows that the rights of ALL indigenous communities, including Alaska Natives, are at risk if he is confirmed. … Republican AGs are suing to scrap protections for pre-existing conditions—& despite promises, the Trump Admin is on their side. Once again, they’re trying to take healthcare from the 100s of thousands in #NM & millions across the country who need it most. … We must empower all tribal communities to provide victims the services they need. I'm proud of progress we made on this in the last Violence Against Women Act & I know we can build on it when we reauthorize #VAWA. I'm committed to vastly improving safety of Native women & girls. Often the public doesn’t know the extent of this violence, so we established National Day of Awareness for Missing & Murdered Native Women & Girls. As Vice Chair of @IndianCommittee I'm focused on collaborating w/colleagues, law enforcement & tribal communities on real solutions. Crimes against Native women too often go unreported, undocumented, or uninvestigated. The high rates of missing Native girls & women is alarming & must have the full attention of the @IndianCommittee #MMIW … One year ago, @POTUS rescinded #DACA & left #NM’s 8,000 #DREAMers in limbo. Instead of working on a solution, he's dealt in anti-immigrant rhetoric & rejected bipartisan fixes. I won't stop fighting until #DREAMers can live out their futures in the only home they've ever known. I oppose Judge #Kavanaugh’s nomination, and I am demanding Senate #Republicans halt these proceedings. @POTUS has possible felonies hanging over his head. President Trump should not be able to appoint a justice who could rule on his own legal issues.pic.twitter.com/hbwO5VtEBS WATCH LIVE: I’m on the Senate floor, joining @SenWhitehouse to raise the alarm about climate change and its devastating impact on New Mexico, the West, the nation, and the world.  … On #LaborDay we celebrate #NM workers & the progress the labor movement has made to improve conditions & opportunities for people everywhere.   Today & every day we stand with workers in their fight to make sure everyone is treated fairly & with dignity in the workplace. "We disagree in politics—but not in life."  As we pay our respects to John McCain today, I've shared a few words about what his life has meant to me, my family, and our nation.   Let us harness John's fight & courage to defend the ideals that he cherished. … Many of my best childhood memories include exploring the Southwest's great outdoors. #NM offers kids so many adventures, from hiking mountain trails to climbing trees in a city park. #LWCF ensures our children & grandchildren will get the same experience.  pic.twitter.com/ZQPyI1A5jM Amazing to see the community come together to support what we know to be true: the #LWCF is essential, it’s worth celebrating, and #NM isn’t going to stop working to #ProtectLWCFpic.twitter.com/5Q7XUVjhle I'm heartbroken about yesterday’s fatal bus crash on I-40 in #NM. Jill & I join our fellow New Mexicans in keeping our thoughts with the victims, their loved ones & all affected by this tragedy. We send our gratitude to first responders who assisted in this great time of need. Glad my office is hosting a community event in #SantaFe this morning to celebrate #LWCF & call for its reauthorization. It's vital to #ProtectLWCF, which has played such a significant role in conserving #NM's public lands & funding parks across our state.pic.twitter.com/Grl51K4Jb0 #LaborDay is right around the corner, but @POTUS & the authors of the #GOPTaxScam ignored the fact that everyday Americans need a raise. #WorkersDeserveMore than wondering if they’ll be able to feed their families & pay the bills after a hard day’s work.pic.twitter.com/yJmrSAfyDf The headline says it all: 'Americans Are Making Less Money Despite Trump’s Promises.'  The #GOPTaxScam was a giveaway to the top 1% that completely left working #NM families behind. #WorkersDeserveMore than they're getting. … I want to congratulate the 10 @LosAlamosNatLab finalists in @RandDmagazine's Top 100 Awards.   #LANL researchers do amazing work in science & engineering, and play a key role in #NM’s economy. Great to see their hard work get national recognition. … .@POTUS is admitting the #GOPTaxScam created a “national emergency”. I agree! But instead of working to reverse the damage, he abuses his authority to take $billions more from working families. A billionaire @POTUS is trying to cancel the raises of 22,000 hardworking New Mexicans, citing the "budget."   @POTUS wasn't concerned about the budget when he signed the #GOPTaxScam—blowing a $1.5 trillion dollar hole in the deficit to pay for tax cuts for the rich. … Given attacks on the #FreePress, the Trump/Ross newsprint tariffs were the last thing we needed. I'm relieved #USITC overturned these tariffs, which would have had a devastating impact on the #NM local papers already facing so many economic barriers. … More than 500 kids are still wondering if they’ll see their families again. It’s been 32 days since the court-ordered deadline to reunite them & at least 10 months since the Trump admin. started separating families.   @POTUS, end this inhumanity now. #FamiliesBelongTogetherpic.twitter.com/80MDL90Dgz We grieve for each and every person who lost their life as a result of #HurricaneMaria.   The Trump administration's lackluster response failed our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico. Now, we must do everything we can to help Puerto Rico recover from this terrible tragedy. … Fifty-five years ago today, #MLKjr gave his historic “I Have a Dream” speech at the #MarchOnWashington. In his honor, let us pause to consider his powerful words, the strides our nation has made, and the work we have to do to realize Dr. King’s dream.pic.twitter.com/aLWujSkcCv On Wednesday at 6PM, my #ABQ staff & representatives from US Military Service academies will host an event at @UNM to field questions from potential applicants. It's an honor to nominate some of #NM's brightest young people to service academies each year.pic.twitter.com/P1fRdc7Dcc Until @POTUS’ tentative deal is made public, the American people will be left wondering what was accomplished.   One thing we do know? @POTUS' chaotic approach on trade has hurt #NM. We need a deal that protects our workers, economy & environment. … The @CFPB's top student loan official is resigning because @BCFPDirector Mulvaney has so deeply undermined protections for student borrowers. If you think that’s the opposite of what the agency tasked with Consumer Protection should do—you're right. … The nation—and the world—will miss John’s fierce independence and his unwavering dedication to doing what is right — no matter the cost. Now more than ever, during these uncertain times, let us all strive to follow in Senator McCain’s footsteps and to rise to his heroic example. It is a privilege to have known John McCain – to have served with him in the Senate, and to call him a dear friend. John’s fearlessness, his unyielding integrity, and his generosity of spirit truly touched the entire Udall family. We will miss him dearly. 102 years ago today, @NatlParkService was established to protect our public lands and natural wonders. From Carlsbad Caverns to White Sands to Bandelier, #NPS helps preserve some of the most beloved parts of the Land of Enchantment for generations to come. #NPS102 #NPSBirthdaypic.twitter.com/ZY8tgZ6Bde Every day #NM sees the dangers of climate change in action. This drought impacts everyone & everything, from businesses, to farmers, to wildlife. We need to work together to fight climate change— for our economy, our environment, & our communities. … Jill and I are sending all of our love, thoughts, and prayers to John, Cindy, and the entire McCain family. John McCain is a hero, a fighter, a patriot – and above all, a true friend. … Under @SecNielsen’s leadership, the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant policies have provoked the worst immigration crisis in modern times. I continue to call on the administration to change course immediately.pic.twitter.com/nm5ndVlBCH New @CFPB policies could leave #NM’s 12,000 active-duty military and their families vulnerable to predatory lending. There’s no excuse for financially abandoning them, and bureaucracy is a pretty sorry one at that. It’s incredibly disappointing to see @BCFPDirector Mulvaney hide behind red-tape instead of working with us to protect service-members. … The court ordered @POTUS to reunify children & parents a month ago. 565 kids, many younger than 5, are still separated from families. Our amendments support the well-being of children in #HHS custody, but @POTUS needs a plan to rectify this inhumanity now. #FamiliesBelongTogether By ripping these families apart, @POTUS has inflicted unconscionable harm on innocent kids. The policy is completely un-American, and made worse by the fact that these kids are in unstable and potentially unsafe environments. I'm working with @MartinHeinrich to hold Trump administration accountable for its continued failure to reunite families they tore apart. Our amendments mandate real transparency and require @HHSGov to provide better care for children still in its custody. … I proposed an amendment w/ @SenCapito & @MartinHeinrich to fund #CareCorps, @RepLujanGrisham's plan to build caregiving services. #CareCorps would be a game-changer for #NM's growing senior population & the 400,000+ providing unpaid care across our state. … Great to discuss Native language revitalization in @IndianCommittee today, especially as I work towards reauthorizing the Esther Martinez grants program. I'm committed to expanding this program so Native students throughout Indian Country can deepen their cultural connections. Proud to have worked for this critical funding to help secure #NM's voting systems. We must do everything we can to protect our democracy from outside interference, and to ensure that the voice of the people—and no one else—is heard on Election Day.  … For five decades, the #LWCF has been one of America's best conservation programs. Congress must act & permanently reauthorize the #LWCF to preserve #NM's outdoor spaces—from urban parks to national forests—for generations to come. … Congress is a coequal branch of government, & GOP leaders need to put country before party. We must act immediately to protect the special counsel. And we should NOT be rushing a lifetime #SCOTUS appointment while this cloud of corruption is hanging over the administration. Today, the president's campaign chairman was convicted on 8 counts. The president's personal lawyer admitted--under oath--that @realDonaldTrump directed him to violate campaign finance laws.  No amount of desperate spin from @POTUS can change those facts. .@EPA's own scientific analysis shows the Trump dirty air plan means more carbon pollution and toxic emissions—leading to as many as 1,400 premature deaths and 48,000 new asthma cases over the next 12 years. This #CleanPowerPlan repeal is shameful. … While #NM communities grapple with raging wildfires and increasingly severe droughts, Trump @EPA again undermines our safety & kills the #CleanPowerPlan. Climate change denial in service of big polluters will have grave consequences for future generations. … Joined all 49 @SenateDems in calling on @BCFPDirector Mulvaney not to abandon our servicemembers. @CFPB must safeguard #NM’s 12,000 active-duty military and their families from fraud and predatory lending.  pic.twitter.com/rxFnN2PlCp #NM continues to stand at the forefront of increasing access to #STEM education for underrepresented communities.

Here in Washington, I'm working hard on initiatives—like putting wifi on school buses and strengthening #STEM programs—to help ensure every New Mexico kid gets the education they deserve.pic.twitter.com/yNIRM0fBzN I stand with newsrooms across #NM against @POTUS’ attacks on this vital pillar of our democracy.  As @CrucesSunNews says, the role of the #FreePress "will not be diminished. The noise will never replace the public’s appetite for the news.” … Journalists report the facts—so “‘we, the people’ can make wise & informed decisions.” -@abqjournal … The independent press is there to speak truth to power and shine a light on injustice. Our democracy cannot function without it. @thenewmexican … All this because today, newsrooms across the country came together to speak out for the #FreePress. And newspapers in #NM joined in to remind us that journalists are not our enemies. The press is loyal—to the truth. @VCNewsBulletin  … Once again, @POTUS is recklessly attacking the 1st Amendment. As I said in @SenateCommerce today, these threats shake the very foundation of our democracy. It's more important than ever that public officials speak out in support of the #FreePress … On the 6th anniversary of #DACA, we renew our commitment to #ProtectDreamers. Dreamers reflect our nation's values of hope, opportunity and diversity—and they deserve the chance to live out their dreams in the United States, the only country they call home.pic.twitter.com/Osftj41AVw The Senate cannot fulfill its duty to advise and consent without a full evaluation of Judge #Kavanaugh’s record. Given that #SCOTUS’ influence is particularly acute in Indian Country, we need full access to ALL records pertaining to Kavanaugh’s work on Native American issues. #SCOTUS decisions have a major effect on nearly all aspects of daily life in Indian Country. As the top Democrat on @IndianCommittee, I’m requesting @SenJudiciary obtain & turn over all records of Judge #Kavanaugh’s work on Native American issues. #WhatsAtStakepic.twitter.com/mXoJj1rDjv 83 years ago, FDR signed #SocialSecurity into law & our most effective anti-poverty program was born.

Read my full statement:  … … Last year, I introduced a bill to #BanChlorpyrifos--because the Trump EPA refused to act to protect children & farmworkers. And today, a federal court is telling the EPA that there was “no justification” for rejecting the science and keeping #chlorpyrifos on the market. The Trump @EPA reversed the ban on #chlorpyrifos, a toxic pesticide linked to brain damage in kids. They put the profits of Dow Chemical ahead of the safety of our children.   Now, a federal court is telling EPA it must #BanChlorpyrifos. This is a major victory for public health. … Any conglomerate this large would undermine independence and shut out diverse voices in the media & local broadcasting. This merger was especially dangerous under the leadership of Sinclair, which misled the @FCC to try and get this deal approved. … The termination of the Sinclair-Tribune merger is good news for people who depend on reliable local news to stay informed. Proud to have worked with @SenatorCantwell & countless Americans who spoke up & helped stop this unprecedented corporate consolidation of local broadcasting. Excited to see that #NM is the No. 8 #AmeriState in the country. It’s wonderful that so many young people get involved in @AmeriCorps programs, dedicating themselves to service in our communities.pic.twitter.com/YkDCpRpHu9 In Congress, I’m going to keep working to make sure that Native Americans, and all Americans, can fully exercise their right to vote and make their voices heard in our democracy. … To this day, our work to carry on Miguel Trujillo's legacy--to ensure that every Native American and every American can exercise their right to vote--continues.   Voter suppression efforts across the country are putting undemocratic barriers on the voting rights of millions. 70 years ago, a federal court affirmed the right of Native Americans to vote in New Mexico. The plaintiff in that case was Miguel Trujillo, Sr.–an unsung hero in #NM history. … I’m leading 23 Senators in telling @SecretaryZinke that he must REJECT new mining claims within our national monuments--especially while @POTUS' attacks on public lands are being challenged in court.   New mining within the boundaries of a national monument is illegal.pic.twitter.com/KuKgvq6Oo7 Proud that the Senate passed our bipartisan Interior & Environment funding bill--a major accomplishment. I fought to keep new anti-environment provisions out of the bill, and to reject the Trump administration's devastating cuts to public lands and environment programs.pic.twitter.com/JQNIPqIdPV As a former prosecutor, I call this obstruction of justice. No one is above the law—not even the president. People in New Mexico and across the country are tired of ultra-rich and powerful people like Donald Trump trying to abuse their power to protect themselves. … The Trump @EPA has never met a toxic chemical it doesn’t like. The EPA’s job is to protect public health. Our request is simple: take #TCE off the shelves before more Americans are hurt. Under the Obama administration, the @EPA proposed banning #TCE because it causes cancer & liver, kidney, and neurological damage. But when @POTUS took over, the Trump administration listened to its friends in the chemical industry & decided not to move forward with the bans. WATCH LIVE: I'm standing with Americans whose loved ones have been hurt by the toxic chemical #TCE. It's time for the Trump @EPA to stop dragging its feet and ban this dangerous chemical once and for all.  … Native American veterans put their lives on the line for our nation. Yet too often, they face barriers to accessing the services they earned. My bipartisan bill will help ensure that we are serving Native veterans as well as they served the United States. … I'm joining @SenatorTester in introducing the #SpotlightAct to bring some badly-needed transparency to our elections.

They rallied yesterday against @POTUS’ attacks on unions, & I stand with them--and salute the progress that unions have helped us achieve. #UnionStrongpic.twitter.com/nsxqEv8jqf .@POTUS is a walking conflict of interest. Millions of Americans are asking: is President Trump working for the American people, or is he working for himself?pic.twitter.com/04n1QQnlwD WATCH LIVE: I'm questioning Secretary Pompeo in the Foreign Relations Committee. Last week, @POTUS shunned our allies, stood next to Putin and refused to defend the integrity of American democracy.

We must send a clear message that extreme, partisan efforts to gut bedrock endangered species and environmental protections will not pass muster in Congress. … WATCH LIVE: I'm speaking on the Senate Floor in support of my bipartisan Interior & Environment funding bill. This bill rejects @POTUS' devastating cuts & provides critical investments in the environment, public health, public lands, Indian programs & more. … Tribes have a right to govern themselves—and decisions made by Indians for Indians produce the best outcomes in Native communities. Read my op-ed with @SenSchumer in @indianz about @SenateDems' commitment to expanding Tribal Self-Determination: … Without the #EndangeredSpeciesAct, the bald eagle & the gray whale would likely be extinct. Now, the Trump administration wants to put imperiled species up for auction--and sell them and their habitats off to the highest bidder.   We must fight back. … Thousands of kids are still separated from their families, many seeking asylum—locked up like criminals by the Trump administration.   We cannot lose sight of that, no matter what outrageous comment @POTUS makes on a given day. We cannot rest until every family is reunited.pic.twitter.com/wnj17jzpKS “Treated worse than dogs.” The firsthand accounts of detention conditions from immigrant children and parents are appalling and heartbreaking.   These families will forever bear the scars of the Trump administration's inhumane immigration policies. … Thanks to @RepLujanGrisham & @repbenraylujan for leading the House version of our #ANTIQUITIESActOf2018, to protect our precious national monuments from political attacks.

With this decision, the Trump administration is making an already rigged system even worse. … Days ago, the Justice Department indicted 12 Russians for their role in interfering in a U.S. election. Now, the Trump administration is making it easier for foreign interests to secretly influence our political system. … Joining New Mexicans in cheering on Albuquerque's own @ABREG_1 in his @MLB #AllStarGame debut tonight! … Following Scott Pruitt's resignation, I'm calling on @EPAAWheeler to take immediate action to rebuild public trust at EPA, and to stop the administration's roll-backs of critical protections for clean air, clean water and public health.pic.twitter.com/bcHC90gxAc WATCH LIVE: We're holding a bipartisan roundtable in the @IndianCommittee on voting rights, access, and barriers in Indian Country. We must ensure that Native Americans have equal access to the ballot box and an equal voice in our democracy.  … I've long demanded increased scrutiny of Sinclair’s merger, because it would hurt local broadcasters and give far too much power to a corporation that has abused the public trust. Given that @FCC cites potential "deception" & "misconduct," halting this merger is the right move. … What we are seeing is dangerous & unprecedented. Real action is needed to protect our democracy.  Congress must protect the Mueller probe. And GOP leaders in Congress should convene oversight hearings on @POTUS' bizarre and reckless approach to Russia and NATO. While the whole world was watching, @POTUS refused to defend the integrity of American democracy and instead parroted Russian propaganda. Millions of Americans want to know why.pic.twitter.com/adQ8gryoyY I was honored to join Muhammad Yunus to welcome 150 artists--from 50 countries--to Santa Fe's 15th International Folk Art Market.

Congrats to the Cochiti Pueblo’s @KCLC6 and Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo on their awards from @FNDI303’s Native Language Immersion Initiative, which will provide key cultural education opportunities for a new generation of Native language speakers. … Congress, including Republican leaders, must ensure that the Mueller probe continues without interference. This is no witch hunt. And yet @POTUS continues to go after the special counsel, the FBI, the Intelligence Community—everyone except Vladimir Putin & the government that meddled in our elections. … #ClimateChange is real—and nonpartisan agencies like the @NSF are crucial to educating the public about its effects.

Failure to be open and honest about the number, status and fate of these children will not be tolerated. #ReuniteEveryChildpic.twitter.com/AVlSLr4EXp We should not consider this #SCOTUS nomination legitimate -- not until we return to a real advise and consent process as required by the Constitution. .@POTUS has farmed out the selection of his #SCOTUS nominee to far-right interest groups. The result is that a majority of the country is being left with no voice on an appointment that could span decades. Make no mistake: these extreme, far-right groups put Judge Kavanaugh's name on their wish list for a reason. #SCOTUS .@POTUS pulled Judge Kavanaugh’s name from a pre-approved list concocted by radical special interests that are committed to undermining a woman’s right to choose, health care protections, safeguards for workers & seniors, LGBTQ rights, & so many other critical public protections. It is the Senate’s constitutional duty to advise and consent on #SCOTUS nominees. But after @SenateMajLdr made a mockery of the #SCOTUS nomination process, the only advice and consent that @POTUS has sought out is from the extreme, right-wing groups who hand-picked this nominee.pic.twitter.com/L8dMsIdC6N Let’s not forget: Scott #Pruitt was carrying out Donald Trump’s toxic policies at the EPA. And there’s no indication Andrew Wheeler will be any different. We can’t stop fighting back. … The American people’s disgust with Scott Pruitt should serve as blaring red siren for the Trump administration. Americans will not tolerate another EPA administrator whose primary goal is to fight the core mission of the EPA. Scott Pruitt’s tenure at EPA was an utter disgrace. He treated his position as a golden ticket for his own personal benefit – at the expense of the health and wellbeing of American families and the environment. #Pruitt should have been fired long ago. … We are not Americans just because of an oath, or a piece of paper. We are Americans because of an idea: the idea of freedom and justice for all. On #FourthofJuly2018, let's come together to honor the sacrifices of men and women in uniform, veterans, & military families--and to uphold the values that they have fought so hard and given so much to protect. It’s clear that environmental protection is the last thing on Scott Pruitt’s mind. It’s long past time for him to go. #FirePruitt … The Senate came together in bipartisan fashion to pass my amendment preserving critical protections for children and farmworkers--people who work day in and day out to feed our nation & the world. … The #CapitalGazette shooting is a horrifying tragedy. My thoughts are with the victims, their loved ones, & all affected by this appalling act.  Now more than ever, every public official must speak up to defend the free press. And we must act to end such senseless gun violence. If the McConnell rule was in place in the 2016 election year, it should be in place in 2018. Given @POTUS' attacks on due process and the rule of law, we should let the people speak before we consider his next #SCOTUS nominee. WATCH LIVE: I’m speaking on the Senate floor about my visit to the border to hold @POTUS accountable for his immoral family separation policy. We cannot rest until every child has been reunited with their parents in a humane way. #FamiliesBelongTogether  … History has shown that unions raise incomes, sustain our families, and lead to stronger communities. #SCOTUS today did the opposite, and made a rigged system worse for working families and a shrinking middle class. #Janus … WATCH LIVE: I'm about to testify in @senjudiciary to call for bipartisan legislation to provide justice and compensation to all New Mexicans, Native Americans, and families affected by exposure to radiation during the Cold War. … Last week @SenatorTomUdall & I visited the border & witnessed the crisis that Pres Trump created by separating families. We're calling on for congressional hearings on the Trump Administration’s treatment of migrant children. #FamiliesBelongTogether  pic.twitter.com/RrA2U6hact People in #NM and across the country unknowingly sacrificed their health and even their lives to our national security efforts during the Cold War. We can’t undo the years of suffering they endured, but Congress must act to deliver justice and compensation to these victims. Tomorrow in @senjudiciary, I'll be fighting for justice for victims of radiation exposure who have been unjustly denied compensation under RECA for far too long--including the Tularosa Basin Downwinders & the post-1971 uranium workers in Northwestern #NM. … At the border, I saw firsthand the humanitarian crisis that the president has created with his immoral family separation policy. @POTUS needs to immediately communicate how he plans to reunite these thousands of children with their mothers and fathers. #FamiliesBelongTogetherpic.twitter.com/rcdL7AeNPP Jill & I were deeply saddened to learn that Lt.

HAPPENING NOW: I'm on the border with @MartinHeinrich & @SenBlumenthal to hold the Trump administration accountable for its inhumane #FamilySeparation policy and cruel immigration agenda. #FamilesBelongTogether And I opposed the @DHSgov funding bill because we need to reunite the thousands of children and families that have been cruelly separated by @POTUS’ #FamilySeparation policy. Today in @SenateApprops, I voted NO on funding @POTUS’ border wall.

The bill gives a well-deserved pay raise to our men and women in uniform--and it includes several provisions I championed to benefit #NM’s veterans, military families, bases and labs. … With one phone call, @POTUS could end this horrific policy. If he won’t—then Congress must step in.   Every Senate Democrat supports the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct. It’s time for Republicans in Congress to join us to #EndFamilySeparation. This is shameful. We won’t stand by as President Trump holds defenseless children hostage for his offensive border wall. … I won’t stop fighting until the Trump administration stops tearing children from the arms of their mothers and fathers, and until these families are reunited. If @POTUS won’t change course, then Congress needs to step in and pass the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct.pic.twitter.com/99VEUBWbjU Let me be clear: @POTUS could end this morally repugnant policy in a matter of minutes. But instead, he’s using these defenseless children as a bargaining chip to try and build his wall. #EndFamilySeparation Yes, this is a moral showdown – and we won’t back down. The president must immediately reverse his horrifying policy separating children from their mothers and fathers. #KeepFamiliesTogether … .@EPA and @HHSGov have a job to look out for public health.

Then it turned into just 'moaning and moaning'...He recently slept through the night for the first time." … U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw says the practice of separating children from their parents at the border is "brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency."   I agree. #FamiliesBelongTogether … .@POTUS' decision to separate children from their parents at the border is cruel, unnecessary & goes against our American values - and is causing life-long trauma to children who are fleeing extreme violence. @POTUS must end family separation immediately.  … A record number of members of Congress have signed on to my resolution calling for Scott Pruitt to resign.

Updates and information can be found at  . This cozy relationship is a slam dunk deal for Scott Pruitt and for the big polluters. Meanwhile, American families are paying the price.   The corruption at EPA needs to end. #Pruitt needs to resign. Now we learn @EPAScottPruitt sat in the VIP seats of a coal baron whose industry Pruitt is supposed to be regulating.   And then big polluters got their wish list: rollbacks of the critical environmental protections that keep your air and water clean. … Congratulations to the hard-working “crew” at @LaPostaMesilla for this special recognition!

Reply below or email SenTomUdall@tomudall.senate.gov. … “Communities across New Mexico…are living with pollution from abandoned hard rock mines, and taxpayers—not the polluters—are often paying for cleanup.” Congress needs to step up & pass @MartinHeinrich & my bill to put #NM communities ahead of corporations … Great op-ed on why we need #miningreform to protect #NM communities and end the sweeatheart deal that has allowed big mining corporations to rip off taxpayers for over 150 years. … While it may be missing in this White House, many people in public life still practice civility – and there’s no better examples than John and Cindy McCain.  … 1 year ago, Western senators defeated the attempt to repeal BLM’s #methane waste rule.

They bring visitors to our communities & drive growth in our economy. I'm proud to work with @GoParks to preserve these special places for generations to come. … The free press should be loyal to the truth—not to the president. Will @AjitPaiFCC speak up for the 1st Amendment, like he promised? Or will he stand by as @POTUS threatens to punish the press for negative coverage? … The internet should be free and open to all New Mexicans. But the Trump admin's repeal of #netneutrality empowers big businesses at the expense of ordinary people.

In 2017, they drove $116 million in spending in our state, supporting 1,720 jobs and boosting local businesses. … Our #MonumentsForAll belong to all of us. They should not be sold off to the highest bidder. We will keep fighting to protect these special places which are a part of our history, our heritage, our local economies and our way of life. The public has made it clear they believe that #MonumentsForAll should remain protected. More than 99% of the three million Americans who commented on the DOI’s plan supported upholding protections for our natural treasures.

Republicans & @POTUS must decide if they'll defend the indefensible or join our call for his resignation.  At today's Appropriations Committee hearing, I highlighted the need to give #NM bases the resources they need to keep America safe and support our service members & their families, and I advocated for the permanent relocation of #F16s to Holloman AFB.  Good meeting with #NM @AARP to discuss the issues facing seniors in our state.

But after roughly $569 million in spending on lobbyists, Trump & Republicans in Congress passed the #GOPTaxScam—an unprecedented giveaway to corporations & the richest Americans. Forgive the wordplay—pay-to-play policies are no joke. They make politicians more concerned with what their campaign donors want than what their constituents need. The WH must clarify if Mulvaney’s corrupt policy—no access without $$$—is prohibited for the WH & federal agencies. Democracy is supposed to be a system of self-government, not sell-government. … Attacks on our #MonumentsForAll are an attack on the communities whose history and heritage they celebrate. Across the country, Americans are raising their voices and fighting back against @POTUS' rollback of protections for our #publiclands. I'm proud to stand with them. … Thank you to @SenWhitehouse and @SenateDems for bringing attention to the Koch's powerful influence empire. When the richest Americans get to call the shots in Washington, #NM families lose. It's time to overturn #CitizensUnited & stop the Koch's attack on our clean air & water.

Watch live on @CNN. Pruitt seems more interested in using his power to help himself, campaign donors & his industry friends than protecting our health & safety. President Trump promised he would fight corruption and #DrainTheSwamp—so why is he ignoring his own cabinet official's corrupt behavior? Every day we see more rollbacks of air and water protections while the list of @EPAScottPruitt's ethical transgressions grows longer. It’s hard to keep track, so here's a compilation on the different ways he has abused your taxpayer dollars and his office: … I just voted against Mike Pompeo's nomination in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Pompeo has shown that he'll double down on @realDonaldTrump's worst instincts and policies. He isn't the right person to be America's top diplomat.

He has been a disaster, and it’s past time for him to go. In response to my request w/ @BettyMcCollum04, @USGAO found @EPAScottPruitt violated federal law with his $43,000 "privacy booth"—another example of how he's breaking laws & ethics rules that protect taxpayers from government waste, fraud & abuse to help himself to perks & favors … Sporadic strikes aren’t in our national security interest & haven’t sent Assad running-they have emboldened him. We can’t afford endless war in the region. Military action won't solve the conflict in #Syria; that will take diplomatic engagement in the region & w/ Assad’s allies. .@POTUS must seek a new authorization from Congress to wage war in #Syria. I will continue to push Congress to debate and pass an #AUMF and require the administration to fully explain its strategy, and the cost, impact on American troops, and the parameters of its plans in Syria. This isn’t reality TV — tough talk with no long-term strategy puts the Syrian people, American troops, and our allies in danger. The U.S can’t afford to be dragged deeper into the Syrian civil war, and doing so risks a great power conflict. Assad’s violence is horrendous, & he must be held to account by the international community for the many thousands of his fellow Syrians he has murdered. But @POTUS is dangerously escalating the situation in #Syria by acting w/ no legal authority & no consistent, thoughtful plan. I'm voting against Mike Pompeo. We need a secretary of state who has the will & vision to bring this admin. back from the brink, so that we can meet the unprecedented challenges facing America & the world.

It’s time for him to go. … Making decisions on people’s lives and careers in a closed room of political staff with no notes, criteria or information is not how we run government. 12 of the SES employees believe they were reassigned because they did work on climate change, energy, or conservation. These career public servants were only doing their jobs & should be celebrated for their service without regard to the administration they serve. My statement:pic.twitter.com/0YYMuCyZen These moves also disproportionately impacted Native Americans, with 11 Native American employees targeted in this wave of reassignments. Diversity is a good thing. @Interior should be looking to cultivate and celebrate, not denigrate, its diverse workforce.

Now, NYT is reporting 5 separate EPA career & political officials were reassigned or demoted after confronting Pruitt about his spending & management … I always believed Pruitt would be a disaster for health & safety, but I've been shocked at how brazenly he has abused the taxpayers’ trust & his office.    It’s past time for him to go. I'll introduce a resolution soon calling on him to resign for the good of the American people. But that isn’t all—he's done this while making a mockery of ethics laws that protect taxpayers from government waste and fraud. He's taken $100,000s from taxpayers & spent it on perks for himself, while trying to slash the budget for the EPA's critical health & safety programs. .@EPAScottPruitt should resign.

Now Scott Pruitt & the EPA want to prevent them from getting access to nonproprietary safety information on the pesticides they’re exposed to. RT if you agree he should reconsider. Pesticides like #chlorpyrifos have been linked to brain damage in children—even residue on fruit at the grocery store is a danger. So why are Scott Pruitt & the EPA trying to weaken standards that prevent kids under age 18 from applying pesticides?

It would put us on a cleaner, more sustainable path to combat the urgent threat of climate change, cut pollution and protect our planet. The environmental benefits of the RFS haven’t been realized.

I wish you well. We should be making direct investments in the success of our country’s greatest asset, the American people—not writing giveaways to corporations and CEOs and hoping that it trickles down to working families. … President Trump and Republican leaders said their tax bill would help working people, but big corporations are using the #GOPTaxScam to line executives and shareholders’ pockets at a record rate—not passing the benefits on to workers. … #DREAMers are not bargaining chips, they are real people with families, jobs and aspirations. They deserve protection and certainty—not more political gamesmanship from @POTUS and Republicans in Congress. #ProtectDREAMers Today is the arbitrary deadline @realDonaldTrump gave Congress to fix the mess he created for #DREAMers. @POTUS sabotaged a bipartisan deal by demanding his xenophobic border wall and attacking immigrant families. I stand with #DREAMers and their families for a #DREAMActNow. On Sept. 5, President Trump created a crisis for #DREAMers in #NM and across the country when he rescinded #DACA, and now these bright young people live in limbo.

This not only puts Americans at risk, it undermines the public faith that products & ingredients have been rigorously reviewed to be safe. Americans deserve certainty that the products they buy at hardware & grocery stores don’t endanger their families’ health. We passed #chemicalsafety reform to ensure the @EPA puts the safety of Americans ahead of the interests of chemical corporations. Thanks to @NickKristof for raising awareness about #chemicalsafety.

The belief that every person—no matter their race, religion, class, or identity—deserves the chance to succeed is fundamental to our success and our future. These wonderful portraits of people across America, including 2 from #NM, provide an important reminder: more unites our country than divides us.

I voted no on wasting $25B on an offensive wall on our border. I stand with NM families who oppose @POTUS' effort to impose his xenophobic agenda on our state. New Mexicans of all political backgrounds overwhelmingly support DREAMers and oppose a wall in our backyard. I voted for Coons-McCain, a bipartisan bill to #ProtectDreamers without wasting billions on an offensive wall. @RealDonaldTrump created this crisis for DREAMers. Now @POTUS and Republican leaders are doing everything to stop us from fixing it. An inaccurate census risks underrepresentation for Tribal communities. An undercount can lead to skewed state, local & federal voting districts and inequitable allocation of federal funding. This makes it all the more important we get the 2020 census right. WATCH: Today I led a hearing on improving the census in Indian Country. Valid and accurate census data is the bedrock of fair, proportionate representation in our democracy, and it’s critical Tribal communities’ voices are heard and accurately represented.  … My heart breaks again today at news of the school shooting in Florida.

Our efforts must reflect America's proud immigrant history and preserve the diversity and opportunity—for all—that is our greatest strength. #TrumpBudget is an assault on our children’s future. @POTUS has proposed massive cuts to education funding, teacher training, after school programs & student loans.   These cuts would reverse the investments we've made to give every kid a chance to get a good education & succeed. #TrumpBudget is an assault on working families, slashing Medicare & Medicaid, repealing #ACA & taking away health care from hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans & millions of Americans. We should be investing in helping working families get ahead, not undercutting their future. #TrumpBudget repeats the same toxic attacks on working families’ health care and livelihoods that the American people resoundingly rejected last year.    It makes it clear where @POTUS stands—on the side of wealthy and powerful people like him, and against working New Mexicans.pic.twitter.com/a3Gmq2Ttjy #TrumpBudget would undercut #publiclands protections & wipe out the #LWCF, which funds conservation across America, fuels the $887B outdoor recreation industry & creates jobs.

This is totally irresponsible. … .@ChrisCoons and @SenJohnMcCain’s bipartisan bill to protect #Dreamers is an example of the sort of compromise deal Congress can pass. @realDonaldTrump needs to stop politicking on xenophobic immigration rhetoric, find a seat at the table and make a deal. A large majority of Americans—across party lines—support protections for #Dreamers. And there are bipartisan deals on the table to achieve those protections immediately. So: are Republican leaders going to do the right thing or subject #Dreamers to more uncertainty and fear? #Dreamers strengthen our communities and our country every day. They are not political pawns—they are real people with jobs, families and aspirations. It’s time for Congress to preserve their dreams, protect their futures and pass the #DreamAct. Since 1997, SDPI has resulted in a 40% increase in the # of diabetes clinics in Native communities & the CDC has observed a 54% decrease in diabetes-related kidney failures among American Indian & Alaska Natives.

It’s more urgent than ever for Senate Republicans to join Democrats in passing a bill to protect against the unjust removal of Special Counsel Mueller. We have a duty to act now before it is too late. Cherry picking information to smear the work of career law enforcement officials in order to protect @POTUS from Mueller’s investigation is a cowardly and hyper-partisan attack on Americans who've dedicated their lives to our national security. The Nunes Memo is the latest in an unprecedented, partisan attack on law enforcement agencies & the Special Counsel. Every American should want to get to the bottom of Russian meddling—so why are @POTUS & some in GOP doing everything they can to interfere with this investigation? The latest attacks on the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests – no party’s, no president’s, only Putin’s.  … Trump and GOP’s attacks on Mueller & federal law enforcement are unprecedented. Any attempt to fire Mueller is a danger to national security.   If Trump has nothing to hide, then why are some in the GOP hiding the real facts and smearing career FBI agents in a classified memo?

My #MGTAct w/ @JerryMoran will update federal gov’t IT—like the IRS example—saving taxpayers $20B a year & making us less vulnerable to cyber attack. … The America I love doesn’t insult our neighbors and then slam the door in the faces of people who seek shelter from oppression and the dream of a better life. The American people reject President Trump’s xenophobic politics of hate and division, and I will not accept a ‘take it or leave it’ offer on protection for DREAMers. The White House proposal is insulting, not a serious effort to reach a bipartisan consensus. #DreamActNow “Disinformation … thrives on the absence of healthy confrontation with other sources of information.” Well said. Americans deserve truth from their leaders, and the free press plays an essential role in keeping our government honest. … Trying to intimidate local governments by threatening to take away critical public safety funding will not keep our communities safe, and won't get us any closer to fixing our broken immigration system. … I voted no on Alex Azar's nomination. We shouldn't put American families' healthcare decisions in the hands of a former pharma exec who has opposed lowering drug prices & refuses to acknowledge his former industry is to blame for skyrocketing prices that are hurting our families.

Investing in early childhood education is essential for getting kids on track to advance in school, graduate and pursue a higher education or a career. That’s why I’m encouraged by this proposal to make a proper investment in #NM early childhood education. … Great to meet Sergio today, a student from Pojoaque, & students from across the country who are in DC for the @NAEvangelicals Christian Student Leadership Conference.

This is Congress’ most basic job—I'll be working hard to get our gov't back on track. We still must work together to make progress. The American people don’t support President Trump’s platform of hate and division – and Democrats will not accept a ‘take it or leave it’ offer on immigration that will further tear this country apart. We have an agreement that isn’t perfect, but it is progress: it ends the #TrumpShutdown, extends the Children’s Health Insurance Program for six years, and creates a credible path forward on the DREAM Act.pic.twitter.com/kUVM6Gs0ej Democrats are ready to end this chaotic and dangerous #TrumpShutdown. Mr. President: take yes for an answer.pic.twitter.com/4lwjHrj7NO Democrats are pushing: 1) to fund the military & civilian govt for more than a few weeks 2) to continue CHIP 3) for disaster aid 4) for @POTUS to fulfill his promise to show DREAMers “great heart.” ALL of these are bipartisan, so let’s work together & end this #TrumpShutdown. Republicans control the House, Senate & White House & they have failed to do their most basic function—keep the government running. Democrats are ready to work with Trump and the GOP leaders on a deal as soon as they're ready to take yes for an answer & end this #TrumpShutdown. Proud of the women and men in #NM and across America who—a year after the historic #WomensMarch—​are raising their voices this weekend and continuing to demand true equality, opportunity, and justice for every person in our country. … I won't stop working to end this #TrumpShutdown. Democrats are working w/ GOP senators on a bipartisan budget & solution for DREAMers that also meets @POTUS' demands. When Trump decides what he wants & is willing to work on productive solutions, we'll be ready to go instantly. Early this morning, @clairecmc tried to pass a bill to guarantee military pay and death benefits in the #TrumpShutdown.  Republican Leader Mitch McConnell: I object. WATCH:pic.twitter.com/n3a7RBaxzi I'm ready & willing to work w/ both parties on a responsible long-term budget that funds our military, veterans’ care & opioid treatment, an agreement for DREAMers, a long-term extension of CHIP, & other priorities. And I still believe we can get to an agreement. The 45,000 New Mexicans who work at our labs & bases deserve a long-term bipartisan budget. NM deserves responsible funding for veterans & other critical needs. @POTUS should honor his commitment to protect DREAMers. GOP & POTUS control gov't & they should lead. #TrumpShutdown Responsibility for this #TrumpShutdown is on the shoulders of Republicans and President Trump who control the House, Senate & White House — New Mexicans and the American people need them to show some leadership, come to the table and negotiate in good faith. Republicans & @POTUS control the House, Senate & White House & the #TrumpShutdown is on the verge of happening because they refused to lead on a responsible budget & failed to accept a bipartisan deal to fulfill promises for DREAMers. Time is ticking. Democrats are willing to work to avoid this #TrumpShutdown. But @POTUS & the GOP control Congress & the White House. Will they show some leadership & join us in a good budget deal for the military and the middle class? Let’s be clear: @POTUS is the only one rooting for a #TrumpShutdown. Democrats want a responsible bipartisan budget agreement that gets us off this endless track of damaging CRs & for Trump to honor his commitment to work in a meaningful way to provide protection for DREAMers. .@realDonaldTrump should heed his own words: “if there is a shutdown I think it would be a tremendously negative mark on the president of the United States. He's the one that has to get people together.”  #TrumpShutdownpic.twitter.com/pqbGAQf1Tx ...It’s unfortunate that Trump so far has been unable to take yes for an answer & has preferred to pander to extreme right-wing factions in his own party. The GOP & Trump need to decide whether they'll come to the table and negotiate in good faith or force a government shutdown. Democrats have already been hard at work, with a growing number of GOP senators, on an agreement for DREAMers that also met all of the president’s demands.... There is strong bipartisan opposition to the house GOP's CR. It is time for good faith bipartisan negotiations to find a path forward and avoid the shutdown that President Trump appears to want. I agree w/ the DOD―over 45,000 New Mexicans work hard at our national labs, military bases & other federal installations & related contractors.

Powerful message from @JoeBiden.

It's time for GOP leaders to stop the partisan gamesmanship, put American families' health first, and work with Democrats to reauthorize these programs immediately. 1000 #NM parents get parenting education & training from the Maternal, Infant & Early Childhood Home Visiting Services program. The Special Diabetes Program for Indians helps Native communities treat & prevent diabetes.    The GOP has also failed to fund these crucial programs. In #NM, 17 community health center clinics serve 330,000 patients in 90 underserved & rural communities. They employ almost 3,000 people across the state.  Republican refusal to reauthorize the Community Health Centers Program puts these patients and these jobs at risk. GOP inaction has put access to affordable health care for over 11,000 #NM kids & their families in danger. These families deserve to know—does our nation still believes they deserve every chance to lead healthy, successful lives? We must #ExtendCHIP & keep our promise to them. Families should not have to choose between getting life-saving care for their children and keeping a roof over their heads. But some families may be forced to make such a heartbreaking decision soon if Congress doesn’t #ExtendCHIP now. … Ensuring our kids have the essential health care they need to grow and thrive should be a bipartisan priority. But Republicans in Congress have been playing politics with our children’s health for 100 days. It’s time to put an end to this and #ExtendCHIP now. It's been 100 days since the Congressional GOP let #CHIP expire.   That's 100 days of uncertainty and fear for families of the 9 million kids across America who depend on immunizations, prescriptions & doctors visits through CHIP.   This is unconscionable and unacceptable. I won't stop fighting to keep the internet fair and free for everyone—which is why I am cosponsoring @SenMarkey's resolution to restore #NetNeutrality and protect the open internet. #HappyBirthday to the great state of #NewMexico!pic.twitter.com/UZ8XP5ePEK Read my statement on President Trump’s failure to protect #DREAMers:pic.twitter.com/WfOn6K4Jb5 Welcome to the Senate and congratulations on being sworn in today, @SenTinaSmith and @GDouglasJones!

We can’t know because Trump has refused to release his tax returns. … Republicans made the top 1 percent their top priority by passing their #GOPTaxScam. When will they finally focus on keeping our children healthy by funding #CHIP and protecting some of our nation’s most promising youth with a vote on the #DreamActNow? While the GOP was staying up late to pass tax cuts for their rich donors w/ the #GOPTaxScam: -81 days passed w/out #CHIPFunding & some states were forced to send notices to families that their kids' health insurance could end soon -More than 11,000 Dreamers lost #DACA protection Since the day my Uncle Mo championed the protection of this precious land almost 40 years ago, we have been fending off these attacks and winning the fight to #ProtectTheArctic for future generations. And this fight is still not over.pic.twitter.com/TrI5dtJ9K7 Republicans voted to open the #ArcticRefuge to drilling despite the irreparable harm it will do to its ecosystem, overwhelming opposition from the Gwich’in people who live there & majority of Americans, & a complete lack of evidence that drilling will provide windfall revenue. The #GOPTaxScam will be remembered as a terrible deal for the middle class, but it is also one of the greatest attacks on our #publiclands. To help pay for massive tax cuts for the ultra rich Republicans voted to sell off the #ArcticRefuge to the highest bidder.

But then, this bill wasn’t written for working families. It was written to benefit the most fortunate in our country – at the expense of everyone else. I voted NO on the #GOPTaxScam, which will line the pockets of @realDonaldTrump, his family & the GOP’s billionaire donors. It will be a boon for multinational corporations, but for working New Mexicans and for the rest of the country, this bill will be an utter disaster. Giving millionaires and billionaires a massive tax cut through the #GOPTaxScam will blow a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit — which will lead to huge tax increases for most Americans down the road & cuts to Social Security, Medicare, & Medicaid. Republicans are within hours of passing their #GOPTaxScam in a late night Senate vote. I was on the Senate Floor fighting for working families and opposing this #GOPTaxScam. WATCH:  … BREAKING: House Republicans just passed the #GOPTaxScam to give massive tax cuts to corporations & America's wealthiest -- paid for by working families. The final vote is just hours away in the Senate. The American people deserve better, I'm voting no. Every week hundreds of Dreamers across the country are losing their protected status because of @POTUS' heartless decision to end #DACA. Congress must act. We have a bill, the Republicans should allow a vote. #DreamActNow While Republicans are busy rushing their #GOPTaxScam through before the holidays, they are neglecting the 800,000 young people at risk of deportation. We need a #DreamActNow Communities in #NM depend on strong environmental programs to protect clean air and water, and keep families healthy. Harmful riders that gut these programs have no place in mandatory budget bills. Join us in demanding #NoPoisonPills … Happy 50th anniversary to @GoParks.

Republicans will take a vote on the #GOPtaxscam as early as TOMORROW. But they can still vote it down and choose to work with Democrats on common-sense tax reform to help working families, not just corporations and the super rich. Keep calling and making your voices heard. Dreamers represent the very best of our nation. They are ambitious, talented, passionate young people who want nothing more than to work, get an education, care for their families and contribute to their communities. They deserve protection, they deserve #DreamActNow We have almost 800,000 young people whose lives, dreams, and future hang in the balance. They are scared, their families are scared, and everything they have worked for is at risk. Tell Congress we need to pass the #DREAMActNow Wishing everyone celebrating the festival of lights in New Mexico and across the country a very happy #Hanukkah UPDATE: A last minute addition to the #GOPTaxScam would personally enrich President Trump, his family, and other billionaire real estate developers. Now they’re trying to rush it through Congress days before Christmas. … The Republicans are trying desperately to give their billionaire donors a big gift before the holidays.

This is simply inexcusable, we must act to #FundCHIPNow. It's been 75 days since GOP let #CHIP expire which provides health care for 9,000,000 children. Senate GOP made the time to pass tax cuts for millionaires. They’ve voted to open the #ArcticRefuge to drilling. Yet they continue to ignore children's health. 5 years after #SandyHook, congress has made no progress on commonsense gun laws. Just last week, yet another school—this time in #NM—was touched by a devastating act of gun violence. It is long past time to act to prevent gun violence—we owe it to our children & communities. Today’s vote to repeal #NetNeutrality rules is a major blow to the internet as we know it. @AjitPaiFCC’s legacy will be leading the surrender of the free & open internet to corporations, letting ISPs create internet toll lanes, & stifling online competition, innovation & dynamism Too many New Mexicans, especially in rural areas, are already stuck in an internet slow lane. We should be working to expand broadband access and bridge the digital divide — not repealing #NetNeutrality rules and destroying essential protections for a free and open internet. One thing is clear, the internet is an essential aspect of everyday life. It is not a luxury, it has become a necessity and it should remain free and open to every New Mexican and every American. #ProtectNetNeutrality Who are @FCC Republicans listening to as they dismantle #NetNeutrality? It’s certainly not the millions & millions of Americans pleading with them to keep the internet free & open. I want to thank the many advocates for #chemicalsafety who spoke out against #Dourson — especially the brave families who lost loved ones due to unsafe and unscrupulous practices. Their willingness to share their personal experiences truly made a difference for others. I am glad Michael Dourson did the right thing and withdrew his nomination to head the EPA's chemical safety office. As someone who has spent his career working for weaker safety standards for dangerous chemicals, he was a terrible choice, and he faced bipartisan opposition. He told me that DACA has given him “wings,” and the freedom to work and study at NMSU to pursue his dream of becoming an engineer. He is also a volunteer firefighter and wants to give back to his community. He deserves to feel safe in his home. #DreamActNow Carlos has lived in the US since he was a baby.

Americans don't want massive tax cuts for the ultra rich and they definitely don't want to destroy our public lands to pay for it.pic.twitter.com/buxgDoJnQZ There’s still time to stop this bill. The Republican margin is razor thin. Keep burning up the phones & tell GOP leaders what you think of this #GOPTaxScam before it’s too late. Meanwhile, the #GOPTaxScam’s attack on the #ACA will leave 13 million Americans without health care. And it will cause out of pocket costs to soar across the country. The #GOPTaxScam’s $1.5 TRILLION deficit hole will mean a huge tax increase on most Americans down the road — in the form $12,500 in debt per family and GOP cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. BREAKING: Republicans say they’ve reached a deal on their #GOPTaxScam. Here’s the big picture: huge tax cuts for the rich and for big corporations. Skyrocketing health care premiums and huge deficits for the rest of the country to pay off. Too many New Mexicans, especially in rural areas, are already stuck in the internet slow lane. Instead of rolling back #NetNeutrality  that protects internet openness, we should be finding ways to make affordable high-speed broadband accessible for everyone. If @FCC Republicans succeed in rolling back #NetNeutrality tomorrow, internet service providers will be able to block, slow & throttle internet service for certain sites. Meaning NM students, small biz owners & everyday consumers could see slower download speeds & higher prices. I stand with @SenGillibrand, a consummate professional and an excellent senator. @realDonaldTrump’s tweet is disgusting for a childish bully, and it’s wildly out of line for a POTUS. @realDonaldTrump absolutely should apologize and remove his tweet. … Alabamians deserve to have their senator vote on the tax bill.

How are they going to pay for it? They’re already talking about cuts to programs that help seniors and those most in need, like Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid and food assistance. … If the @HouseGOP gets their way, the #GOPTaxScam will eliminate the deduction for medical expenses. Americans with extensive medical costs could see their taxes go up tens of thousands of dollars per year. … The #GOPTaxScam is an attack on the #ACA. The nonpartisan @USCBO says the bill will result in even higher premiums and would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million. … The #GOPTaxScam doesn't just raise taxes for middle class families (to pay for tax cuts for the ultra rich), it jeopardizes their health. Here's how: There are almost 8,000 DREAMers in NM at risk of deportation because of @POTUS' reckless decision to end #DACA. We should not be tearing apart families, we should be helping these young New Mexicans achieve their dreams. Tell Congress to act and pass the #DreamActNow. There is no excuse for leaving almost 800,000 young people's lives, dreams, and future hanging in the balance.   It's time for a vote on the #DreamActNow, we can't wait any longer to protect our immigrant youth. The GOP is rushing to pass their #GOPTaxScam because the more the American people learn about what’s in it, the more they oppose it. It's irresponsible- and immoral- to cut taxes for the ultra rich & corporations while raising taxes & cutting health care for middle class families "How could anyone trust #Dourson to put public health before the interests of the clients he has spent decades defending?" We can't. The Senate must #RejectDourson. #Dourson has made his living producing junk science for the chemical industry to help them weaken our safety standards. Now, @POTUS wants Dourson to run the EPA's chemical safety office. We can't let that happen. #ScienceForSale When Bonnie Lautenberg talks about chemical safety, we should all listen. Read her op-ed in @CNN on why Michael #Dourson's nomination at EPA threatens the safety of families and children across our country → … Thank you Candice.

RT if you're with me. #StandWithBearsEars #MonumentsForAll In #NewMexico, our national monuments #OMDP4NM and #SaveRGDN are drivers of our economy and central to our way of life. I'll be reviewing this report closely, but let me be clear: @POTUS doesn't have the legal authority to rescind a monument designation.  Our national monuments are lands of stunning beauty & sacred meaning that belong to all Americans. President Trump is taking away protection of your lands -- risking looting & vandalism, and opening to development. #MonumentsForAll #StandWithBearsEars #SaveGrandStaircasepic.twitter.com/k4YMmPm1Ma Donald Trump’s ignorance and repeated disrespect for Native Americans diminish the office of the president of the United States. @POTUS decided to dismantle Bears Ears in secret--and he didn't bother to consult the Tribes who co-manage it. #StandWithBearsEars #MonumentsForAllpic.twitter.com/ZkZph63a6n I stand with Bears Ears and Grand Staircase, and I support the legal fight against this attack on our public lands and heritage. #MonumentsForAll #StandWithBearsEars #SaveGrandStaircasepic.twitter.com/JUvwC5Jvke Thousands of people are rallying to #StandWithBearsEars & #SaveGrandStaircase outside the capitol building in Salt Lake City! You can help - TAKE ACTION   & attend a rally near you  pic.twitter.com/Z8KshPR8ii RT & share the truth: @POTUS’ decision to roll back Bears Ears & Grand Staircase Escalante by over 80% isn’t a reconfiguration of the boundaries. It's the largest frontal assault on public lands in history. #MonumentsForAll #StandWithBearsEars #SaveGrandStaircasepic.twitter.com/T4b7lxO3WE BREAKING: Trump announces sweeping cuts to 2 national monuments. RT now to stand up for #MonumentsForAll! #StandWithBearsEars #SaveGrandStaircasepic.twitter.com/bFLPd1R35f .@POTUS doesn’t have the legal authority to shrink a monument. He's using never-tested, dubious theories to try to reverse designations. He will be challenged in court, & I'll fight him every step of the way in the Senate. #StandWithBearsEars #SaveGrandStaircase #MonumentsForAll .@POTUS is making a mistake that risks the ~$900B outdoor recreation economy & a source of good jobs in NM & across the nation. Shrinking our monuments is bad for our economy & our natural heritage. #MonumentsForAll #StandWithBearsEars #SaveGrandStaircase  Please RT to #StandWithBearsEars!

But this is why we need you to channel your outrage into action — get everyone you know to get organized, speak out, and get ready to vote! We still have the chance to do one good thing with this #GOPTaxScam — STRIKE the provision that would sell off the Arctic coastal plain without real hearings, consultation, public input. I’m voting to #ProtectTheArctic Republicans are setting up a fiscal trainwreck by adding almost $1.5 trillion to the deficit, which threatens future government revenues & long-term budgets for #NM families, schools, labs, bases, scientific research funding, & public lands. Those are some outrageous priorities. We could have had responsible bipartisan tax relief for middle class families. Instead we got the #GOPTaxScam for the very wealthy, multinational corporations & private equity and hedge funds. And it was jammed through complete w/ scribbled notes & no chance to read the details. You can't make this stuff up. … We’ll have plenty of time to talk about the latest #TrumpRussia bombshell. But we need you to keep burning up the phones about the #GOPTaxScam that's barreling ahead on the Senate floor. Senate Republicans don't want you to pay attention to this terrible bill. Show them you are. The #GOPTaxScam will add nearly 1.5 TRILLION dollars to the deficit. Doesn't sound to me like the plan @POTUS promised would pay for itself.pic.twitter.com/Hqiq2JhH7H The #GOPTaxScam will trigger Medicare cuts of up to $410 billion – while wealthy donors enjoy write-offs for private jets.pic.twitter.com/sSzlEDg8mG Q: If the GOP thinks their bill is so good for the middle class, why has it been written behind closed doors? A: Because it’s a #GOPTaxScampic.twitter.com/2KRGtWzfrx Tune in: I'm about to join @180099native to discuss the incredible patriotism and heroism of the Native American Code Talkers. I'll also talk about why I need input from Indian Country on several nominees that the Senate will soon consider ➝   Voting soon on the #GOPTaxScam (spoiler alert: I’m voting no) but still haven't seen the final bill language. What are they hiding? Even more tax cuts for billionaires? More cuts to health care services? More special interest favors? Tune into @MSNBC @ 9:45 a.m MT / 11:45 a.m. ET. I'll be on talking about who loses money in the #GOPTaxScam (working families, seniors, children, the sick & disabled, rural families, & the poor) and who gets new handouts (millionaires, billionaires & multinational corporations). .@SenateGOP is using the #GOPTaxScam to open the #ArcticRefuge to drilling. Drilling does not belong in the Arctic, nor in this corporate tax cut, so we have an amendment to strike it. RT if you agree the world's most wild place is more important than tax breaks for GOP donors.pic.twitter.com/mDzTzVumwZ It's the one trillion dollar question … Very good question, @brianschatz! … The #GOPTaxPlan would have a devastating impact on #NewMexico. It will raise taxes for hundreds of thousands of working New Mexicans, drive up health care premiums and cost our state hundreds of millions of dollars. I'm voting no.  Americans don’t want a tax bill written in secret, cobbled together at the last minute & filled with goodies for special interests. But that’s what we're going to get unless we can defeat the #GOPTaxScam today.   Time is running out—call your Senators now & tell them to vote no. Let’s be very clear:   No middle-class family is demanding permanent tax cuts for corporations. They aren’t demanding a bill that drives up their health care premiums. They certainly aren’t demanding a tax INCREASE.  This #GOPTaxScam is a terrible deal for everyone except the 1%. LIVE NOW: We’re calling on GOP leadership to drop their attempt to open our #ArcticRefuge to drilling as part of the #GOPTaxScam. #NoArcticRider #ProtectTheArctic  … “You have an important opportunity to make a difference—both now & for future generations—by urging your legislators to oppose oil development in one of the world’s most spectacular wilderness areas, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge”  -@JaneGoodallInst … This is what happens when you attempt to subvert regular order. GOP leaders think they can reverse decades of bipartisan agreement to protect our #ArcticRefuge without the American people noticing. Raise your voices and let them know they won’t get away with it. #ProtectTheArctic Yesterday, the Senate Parliamentarian ruled that the arctic drilling rider violates budget reconciliation rules—but the GOP has already drafted a new attempt to loot our #ArcticRefuge in order to pay for tax cuts for corporations and the ultra-wealthy. … The #ArcticRefuge has sustained the Gwich’in people for centuries. It’s home to an incredible array of wildlife including caribou, wolves and polar bears. Drilling would have a devastating impact on the Gwich’in people, their way of life, and this unparalleled natural wonder.pic.twitter.com/bPUGrI3nnJ .@SenSchumer @SenatorCantwell @SenMarkey @SenBennetCO @MartinHeinrich and I will be joined by Gwich'in Tribal leaders, @LCVoters and advocates to call on GOP leadership to give up this shameful attempt to sneak #ArcticRefuge drilling past the American people in their tax bill. .@SenateDems are fighting back against the #GOPTaxScam drilling provision that hands our #ArcticRefuge—one of the last truly untouched places on earth—over to the fossil fuel industry.

Send me your input on these nominees & make your voices heard: SenTomUdall@tomudall.senate.govpic.twitter.com/SH7Gr4nGIr In the coming weeks, the Indian Affairs Committee will be considering two nominees for positions that are critical to Tribal communities: Robert Weaver to be Indian Health Service Director and Tara Sweeney to be Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. Conservative British Prime Minister Theresa May said the president was wrong to stoke hatred against Muslims. Republican leaders in Congress need to stand up and do the same. … This needs to be called out: the president of the United States is retweeting fascist, anti-Muslim propaganda. This behavior is beyond irresponsible and exceedingly dangerous, even for this president. #GOPTaxScam will help corporations & the ultra wealthy & leave working Americans out to dry. It repeals the state and local tax deduction, a key provision for middle-class families, but reduces the estate tax - a tax break only 30 NM families are wealthy enough to benefit from. The #GOPTaxScam treats corporations better than people. Corporations receive the only permanent tax cut while 1 in 3 working New Mexicans will see their taxes go UP by 2027. "The only way anything ever changes in Washington is when people stand up & demand it. So speak out, post on social media, write letters to the editor, & get everyone you know to help make sure Dourson is never confirmed to this position." @SenGillibrand … “When Dourson delivers for his industry clients, it is the public who pays, through weakened health protections. That’s not the quality of person we need in a leadership position in a critical public health agency.” … "Dourson's record suggests that when there is doubt, he does not err on the side of caution in questions of human safety. He errs on the side of what his clients want. That makes him unsuitable to be the people’s lead protector from chemical pollution." … "This nomination is no longer an issue of political affiliations but a concern for the health of the American people." … "Dourson’s past work is bad enough, but to put such a man in charge of chemical safety would be dangerous to people in Parkersburg, Vienna, the Mid-Ohio Valley and those around the country." … "Dourson isn’t just your run of the mill chemical company apologist. He built a career helping companies...weaken & evade federal chemical safety laws…This is precisely the wrong person to ensure Americans aren’t poisoned by chemicals & toxic pollution.” … "Dourson has already taken up residence at the EPA, appointed without confirmation to a special adviser position. It is imperative that we keep our drinking water and our children safe, and send Dourson packing." … “When it comes to chemicals such as these, we need vigilant oversight and continued focus on regulations. The goal should be to keep people safe, but I worry that safety will not be Dourson’s priority.” … "This isn’t about political ideology or whether you support or don’t support President Trump. This is about nothing less than the very basic safety of our drinking water." … "At a time when the EPA has newfound and much-needed authority to test chemicals under the nation’s updated toxics law, passed with bipartisan support just last year, why invite the fox into the henhouse?" The Senate must protect us from Dourson" … "Putting Michael Dourson in charge of implementing this new law for the EPA would be like putting an arsonist in charge of the fire department, a walking, talking example of conflict of interest.” … "Last month I returned to Washington to wage my next fight against cancer, urging my senators to remember that cancer isn’t a partisan issue and chemical safety isn’t either. They must reject Dourson." … "We recently went to Washington to ask our senators 'What if it was your child? How hard would you fight & what lengths would you go to protect not only your own, but all of our children?' Refusing to approve [Dourson] is part of that fight.” … “Dourson is a terrible and, we think, dangerous choice. A toxicologist by training, he has spent years as a consultant for chemical companies, arguing on their behalf for weaker safety standards.” … "The notion of putting Dourson in charge of our chemical safety program is nothing less than absurd...families deserve to know that the products they buy and bring into our homes are safe. We simply cannot trust Dourson to keep our kids safe."  … “Dourson has built a career of abusing science to mischaracterize real-world chemical risks and in doing so has jeopardized public health, including the health of those most vulnerable among us like pregnant women and children.” … "[Dourson] has been paid by chemical companies to produce favorable studies and reports. Now he’s in line to supervise chemical safety at EPA. Someone who has a record of protecting human health and environmental quality ought to hold that job" … Concerned citizens from #Indiana to #WestVirginia to #Tennessee to #Maine to #NorthCarolina are urging the Senate to #RejectDourson. His nomination represents an immediate threat to our public health & safety. RT their stories and help speak out against #Dourson. #ScienceForSale We worked hard to protect #NetNeutrality because the internet should be free, fair, & open to everyone - not subject to gatekeepers or toll lanes. But the FCC is about to roll back rules that have ensured an open & equal internet. We can't let them, tell FCC to #SaveNetNeutrality 3) The bill creates new loopholes for the mega-wealthy and tax dodgers, encourages multinational corporations to ship jobs overseas & big corporations are getting the only permanent tax break - while small biz is getting the short end of the stick. 2) The GOP is using the tax plan as another opportunity to undermine the ACA. Their ACA repeal-without-replace provision to remove Obamacare's individual mandate will result in 13 million more uninsured Americans by 2027 and soaring health care premiums. 1) The GOP plan will hurt NM's working families while lining the pockets of the ultra wealthy. And according to the nonpartisan CBO report released yesterday, it's even worse than we thought. … RED ALERT: Senate Republicans are trying to pass their #TaxBill THIS WEEK. Here are just a few reasons we need to fight it every step of the way: This moment in history won’t overshadow the contribution the Code Talkers made and continue to make to our nation. But at what should have been a solemn ceremony to honor Native veterans, Donald Trump took low even lower. … .@CFPB has already fought for and won $12 billion in relief for 29 million cheated Americans.
