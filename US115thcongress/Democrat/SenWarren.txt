The events described by Julie Swetnick, Ms. Ramirez & Dr. Ford are absolutely heart-wrenching. The idea that the Senate would continue this confirmation process without an FBI investigation is even more revolting.   @realDonaldTrump must withdraw Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Why do Republicans continue to stand behind Brett Kavanaugh? Why does @realDonaldTrump want Rod Rosenstein out?  Simple: They want to protect the wealthy and well-connected above all else. And they’re willing to run over anyone who gets in their way.pic.twitter.com/hk3KaCGGS9 We can build a better future for all our families: one with more economic security, more economic mobility, more inclusive communities, and more chances at finding a decent place to live at a decent price. We just need the courage to fight for it. … My new bill: Makes record investments to build homes including in rural areas. Gets localities to scrap zoning rules that make housing more expensive. Helps first-time homebuyers in formerly redlined areas. Offers relief to families still struggling after the 2008 crash. I’m introducing the American Housing & Economic Mobility Act to build 3 million new homes in 10 years, bring down monthly rents by 10%, & create 1.5 million jobs. By asking 10k of the richest families to pay their fair share, it doesn’t add to the deficit.  … Rural housing in the US is falling apart. Decades of federal discrimination have excluded generations of Blacks from homeownership. Housing costs for everyone, everywhere, are skyrocketing – while America's wealthiest families shield billions from taxes. I have a plan to fix it.pic.twitter.com/4WRScVW4Sp Hurricanes Maria & Irma killed thousands of US citizens and displaced thousands more. It's been over a year, and the Senate still hasn’t held a single hearing about their devastating effects on Puerto Rico & USVI's health & education systems. That’s wrong. … .@realDonaldTrump is trying to turn the American Dream into a nightmare for working families. How about instead of punishing them for being poor, we ask the wealthiest to pay their fair share? Every kid deserves a chance to succeed – no matter where they're from. #ProtectFamilies Last year, @realDonaldTrump & Republicans in Congress gave $1.5 trillion to billionaires & big corps. Now that they’ve picked our pockets, they want to penalize immigrants who need help buying food & accessing healthcare for their kids – the vast majority of whom are US citizens. … If @realDonaldTrump is ready to force out Rod Rosenstein, how much longer until he goes after Special Counsel Mueller? Every resignation and firing brings us one step closer to a constitutional crisis. Congress must immediately pass the bipartisan bill to protect Mueller. If Republicans have blocked an FBI investigation, bullied Dr. Ford, & tried to "plow right through" & put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court – all while holding onto credible information about a second sexual misconduct claim – then this isn’t a confirmation. It’s a cover-up. … Soldiers from the 101st Engineer Battalion MA National Guard, assist in delivering hot plates from Columbia Gas to the citizens affected by the Merrimack Valley gas explosions. Residents in the area are without gas for cooking, hot water & heating until repairs can be completed.pic.twitter.com/s7jLFNkNuJ Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen have claimed thousands of lives – but @SecPompeo supports continuing this war so we don't get in the way of potential weapons sales. Defense industry profits should not outweigh the lives of innocent civilians. … .@SenMajLdr McConnell, @realDonaldTrump, and @SenateGOP are demonstrating why most sexual assault survivors never come forward. But it's not too late to do the right thing. Stop shaming Dr. Ford and twisting yourself into knots to ignore this. Call the FBI and let her testify. Hey, @SenMajLdr McConnell, @realDonaldTrump, & @SenateGOP: Dr. Ford is not a nuisance. She’s certainly not a speed-bump to "plow" over. She is a person. And it shouldn’t be this difficult for the most powerful men in America to treat her with basic human decency and respect. … I met with @danrivera01843 in Lawrence yesterday about #MVGasFire recovery efforts. There’s a lot of work to be done – but we have dedicated professionals on the ground working to get things back to normal. In the meantime, I’ll keep fighting to hold @ColumbiaGasMA accountable.pic.twitter.com/y8fqzYcUKE .@SecretaryZinke has opened up most of the US coastline to offshore drilling, undone key mining regulations, & freed up millions of acres of public land to development. He's supposed to regulate Big Oil & Gas – not do their dirty work. #EndCorruptionNow  …  … .@MickMulvaneyOMB needs to explain why he met with Republican donors and campaign officials. If he asked for donations or political favors, he violated federal law. #EndCorruptionNow … Another disgusting attempt to discredit Dr. Ford, who has risked her own safety and reputation in coming forward. Many survivors of sexual assault choose not to speak out, for a thousand different reasons. But when they do, they deserve to be heard, @realDonaldTrump – not shamed.pic.twitter.com/NjKhMLPU6v All 3 of my brothers served, and thankfully, they all came back safe.

Some ended up in MA – where 300k people have ties to the island. I intro’d a bill to force the Trump Admin to activate a program for displaced families, which @FEMA refuses to do. … Después de que Trump terminó de tirar toallas de papel, regresó a la Casa Blanca e ignoró las secuelas del #HurricaneMaria. Mientras tanto, he luchado para que los sobrevivientes reciban la ayuda federal que merecen. Aquí está todo en lo que he trabajado: … After @realDonaldTrump finished tossing out paper towels, he went back to the White House and ignored the aftermath of #HurricaneMaria. Meanwhile, I’ve been fighting to get survivors the federal help they deserve. Here’s everything I’ve been working on:  En enero, viajé a Puerto Rico y vi de primera mano la devastación causada por el #HurricaneMaria. Vi a nuestros conciudadanos estadounidenses enfrentando desafíos increíbles: cables eléctricos caídos, agua que enfermaba a la gente, y niños sin hogar.pic.twitter.com/QWyn8QNTyS In January, I traveled to Puerto Rico and saw firsthand the devastation caused by #HurricaneMaria. I saw fellow US citizens facing incredible challenges — power lines in the street, water that was making people sick, and children left homeless.pic.twitter.com/HDmZamN2Gt Hoy, hace un año, #HurricaneMaria devastó a Puerto Rico y a las Islas Vírgenes. La pésima respuesta del gobierno federal convirtió un desastre natural en una crisis humanitaria. Miles de ciudadanos estadounidenses murieron, y muchos siguen viviendo en condiciones difíciles.pic.twitter.com/fmjK0puRlo A year ago today, #HurricaneMaria devastated Puerto Rico & the US Virgin Islands. The federal government's shoddy response turned a natural disaster into a full-on humanitarian crisis. Thousands of US citizens died. Many are still living under extremely difficult conditions.pic.twitter.com/S6poKQ5gOy Today @SenWarren and I led 130 Members of Congress in calling on @realDonaldTrump to apologize for and retract his comments questioning the death toll in #PuertoRico.   Those remarks are disgraceful and beneath the dignity of the Office of the President.  Brett Kavanaugh is up for a lifetime appointment to the nation’s highest court. Dr. Ford – and the American people – deserve a full investigation. Republicans shouldn’t rush this. We need to take the time to get it right. .@SenWarren unveiled a bill to require companies disclose their exposure to #climaterisk. "We commend Sen. Warren's efforts to scale up action on #climatechange, pragmatically addressing climate-related financial risks," said @MindyLubber.  …pic.twitter.com/dvOqpM6z3u We can keep our country safe AND uphold our values by helping those fleeing violence and persecution. @realDonaldTrump's decision to drastically cut the number of refugees allowed into the US isn't just bad policy, it's a total failure of US moral leadership. #StandWithRefugees … Seriously? What good could an ex-lobbyist who represented pro-Russia groups possibly be doing at @HHSGov?  My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would slam the revolving door shut on lobbyists who try to waltz into gov't, & ban Americans from getting paid to lobby for foreign governments. … Brett Kavanaugh talking about his high school in 2015: “What happens at Georgetown Prep, stays at Georgetown Prep.”  I can't imagine any parent accepting this view. Is this really what America wants in its next Supreme Court Justice?pic.twitter.com/WhL8YeZQ78 Low-wage workers are especially vulnerable to workplace discrimination and sexual harassment. It’s wrong, and it has to stop. I stand with @McDonalds workers who are striking today to protest sexual harassment on the job, and retaliation for reporting it. … American companies like @Google shouldn't be developing new products to help the Chinese government spy on its citizens. My Accountable Capitalism Act would help reverse the relentless focus on maximizing shareholder value that leads American companies to abandon American values.  … In some Native communities, the suicide rate for youths is 10x the national average. I’m introducing a bipartisan bill with @lisamurkowski & @RepRaulGrijalva to help combat this devastating loss of life & ensure that fewer Native families & communities experience this tragedy. … This is unacceptable. @ColumbiaGasMA needs to take real responsibility here – and part of that includes working overtime to help the thousands of families who have been affected by the #MVgasfires. … The Climate Risk Disclosure Act will help investors determine climate-related risks, encourage markets to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, & reduce the risks of an environmental and financial catastrophe – all without spending a dime of taxpayer money. Markets need to take the many complex risks posed by climate change into account. This isn’t a radical new idea – @algore proposed something similar years ago. It’s a concrete step we can take today.  … On the other hand, if the global community follows through on commitments to limit global warming and move away from the use of fossil fuels, oil and gas companies could be worth a lot less. If climate change continues at this rate, sea levels will rise – putting companies with physical assets near shorelines at risk. More frequent superstorms will interfere with shipping. Longer droughts will result in higher food costs. That can all affect a company’s bottom line. My new Climate Risk Disclosure Act would force public companies to disclose critical information about how climate change could affect the value of their assets so that investors can make smart decisions with their money. Before the 2008 crash, investors and the government failed to address growing risks in our financial system. We’re making the same mistake with climate change today – we know it’s coming, but we’re not doing enough to stop it. I'm introducing major legislation to help fix that. … To all those impacted by Hurricane Florence – especially those who have lost loved ones – know we are with you. Recovery won’t be easy, but the outpouring of volunteers & donations from across America are proof that you're not alone. We’re in this together. … Brett Kavanaugh has played along with the Trump Administration hiding tens of thousands of pages of documents from his time in government service, and now more questions. We need a full and fair investigation – what is he hiding? Christine Blasey Ford is brave, deserves to be heard, and treated with respect as she raises new questions about Brett Kavanaugh.  No votes until that happens. So.

Well for starters, she played a role in his Admin’s cruel family separation policy. @SenCortezMasto and I explain here: … This is a crushing defeat for @BetsyDeVosED, and a huge win for students who have been scammed by #4profit colleges. Way to go Maura! … We’ve had over a year to change the laws that let @Equifax and its executives walk away unscathed after compromising the data of 148M Americans. Congress should pass my bill with @MarkWarner to hold credit reporting agencies accountable to consumers. … The Trump Admin has all the facts here – but continues to support a coalition that bombs schoolchildren on a class trip. It's wrong, and does nothing to make America safer. We should use our influence to bring an end to Yemen’s humanitarian crisis – not contribute to it. 2/2 For months, Congress has raised serious concerns about US support of the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen. @SecPompeo’s response today makes a mockery of congressional oversight authority. It’s not a certification – it’s a rubber stamp for Saudi Arabia. 1/2 … We cannot go back to the time of back-alley abortions. But that could happen if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court and helps overturn Roe v. Wade. We must #StopKavanaugh – the lives and futures of countless American women are at stake. … No, @realDonaldTrump – the Hurricane Maria response was NOT an "incredible unsung success.” Nearly 3,000 US citizens in Puerto Rico died. I've spent a year pushing your Administration on its many failures there. You need to face reality and do your job. … Today, our country comes together to remember those who lost their lives in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We also honor our servicemembers and first responders who put their own lives at risk to protect our country and keep Americans safe. We will never forget.

The American people deserve a Senate that insists on doing its job. What they've got is a Senate that bows to @realDonaldTrump and covers for Brett Kavanaugh. This isn't a SCOTUS confirmation – it's a charade. #WhatAreTheyHiding The Constitution directs the Senate to provide advice and consent on all judicial nominees. We cannot effectively fulfill that duty when @realDonaldTrump refuses to disclose Kavanaugh's record. Senate Republicans know this, too – they just don't care. #WhatAreTheyHiding .@realDonaldTrump's 11th hour move to hide Brett Kavanaugh’s record is unprecedented. When Justice Kagan was nominated, NONE of her WH records were withheld because of executive privilege. So what's in these documents? And why is Trump so eager to bury them? #WhatAreTheyHiding On the eve of Labor Day weekend, only days before the start of Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing, @realDonaldTrump announced he would stop the Senate from reviewing over 100k pages of Kavanaugh’s records from the White House Counsel’s Office. #WhatAreTheyHiding … This Labor Day, as we celebrate the many contributions that unions make to our communities, I’m wishing all the best to the SHARE Union @AFSCME and @MarlboroughHospital as they negotiate to ensure great care for Massachusetts patients and good wages & conditions for workers. … Unions built America's middle class, and unions will rebuild our middle class.

Under my new bill to #EndCorruptionNow, Americans would be banned from getting paid to lobby for foreign governments. If foreign countries want to express their views and influence policy makers, they should use their diplomats – not straw men who violate campaign finance laws. … When John McCain and I worked together, he’d say: “Show some fight. Get in there – throw some punches.” That was his approach to life – if you’re gonna be in a fight, you better give it your all. It was an honor to serve with him. A patriot, a maverick, a fighter to the end. .@realDonaldTrump spends millions of taxpayer $ playing golf at his own resorts & hands out over a trillion in tax giveaways to rich buddies – but he wants to cut pay for hard-working Americans who care for vets, support military operations, & inspect our food?

The @CFPB has returned $750 million to scammed student borrowers. But today, the agency’s top student loan watchdog resigned – because @MickMulvaneyOMB is siding with greedy student loan companies over students and military families. Disgraceful. … I count it as a blessing to have had the honor to serve with John McCain in the Senate and on the Armed Services Committee.

At a time when character & integrity are under siege, we all mourn the loss of a public servant who lived with courage & conviction. John McCain and I disagreed on many things, and sometimes quite forcefully. But even when we disagreed, I always respected that his heart was focused on doing what he thought was best for the American people. John McCain was fiercely devoted to his family, his constituents, and his country. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones during this difficult time. As a nation, we all share in the sense of emptiness his passing has left behind. The GOP is trying everything it can to weaken unions. But we're fighting back every step of the way, & it's paying off. A federal judge just struck down key pieces of @realDonaldTrump’s executive orders designed to roll back federal workers' rights. This is a big win for workers. … Trump’s plan to “regulate” greenhouse gas emissions reeks – of corruption. It’s lead by ex coal lobbyist @EPAAWheeler who’d rather appease his Big Coal buds than protect our environment & American lives. Under my bill to #EndCorruptionNow, he wouldn’t be allowed to run the @EPA. … For decades, American workers have helped produce record corporate profits but have seen their pay barely budge.

Now @BetsyDeVosED wants to allow schools to use limited federal education $ to put guns – GUNS – in classrooms? That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. … The President of the US needs political distractions to turn our gaze away from his criminal cabal, and so he’s attacking South Africa with the disproven racial myth of “large scale killings of farmers” This man has never visited the continent and has no discernible Africa policy I just introduced a set of major reforms to #EndCorruptionNow so we can take power in Washington away from the wealthy, powerful, and well-connected who have corrupted our government, and put power back in the hands of the American people. … A climate related disaster could trigger a worldwide financial crisis the likes of which we’ve never seen before.

You spent so much time schmoozing with the rich and powerful that your constituents voted you out. Then you went to work for Wall Street. I’m shocked – SHOCKED – you don’t like my bill to #EndCorruptionNow. … Since introducing my bill to #EndCorruptionNow this AM: Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign crimes. Paul Manafort convicted on tax fraud. Rep. Duncan Hunter indicted for misuse of campaign funds. And these are just the guys who've been caught.   Time to clean up Washington. Today I introduced a sweeping anti-corruption bill to clean up Washington. My reforms would make it flatly illegal for Americans to work as lobbyists for foreign governments. Congress should pass this law so we never see another snake like Paul Manafort again. #EndCorruptionNow Paul Manafort lied about lobbying for a foreign government and got rich. And it's shocking that @realDonaldTrump's campaign mgr has been convicted of criminal tax fraud. But it's insane that ANYONE is allowed to take shady foreign cash to lobby our government. #EndCorruptionNow I plan to fight to pass as many of these reforms as possible. I believe we can break the stranglehold that the wealthy and well-connected hold over our government. I believe we can get democracy working again. #EndCorruptionNow Inside Washington, some of these proposals will be very unpopular, even with my friends. Outside Washington, I expect that most people will see these ideas as no-brainers and be shocked they’re not already law. #EndCorruptionNow Build a new anticorruption agency to make sure that all key federal officials – even powerful Senators and Presidents – file disclosures and get rid of conflicts. #EndCorruptionNow Big Change Number Six – Hire a new independent sheriff to police corruption. There are dedicated public servants that enforce our ethics laws – but they have less authority than security guards at the mall. #EndCorruptionNow Strengthen the code of conduct for all federal judges – no stock trading, no payments from corporations for attending events, no honoraria for giving speeches, no lavish getaways & fancy hunting trips funded by billionaires. & I mean all federal judges, including SCOTUS justices. Fifth Big Change – Restore faith that ordinary people can get a fair shake in our courts. #EndCorruptionNow Prosecute companies that knowingly mislead government agencies. And stop the practice of companies paying for sham “studies” designed to derail the rulemaking process. #EndCorruptionNow Fourth Big Change – End corporate capture of rulemaking. #EndCorruptionNow We should ban Americans from getting paid to lobby for foreign governments – period. If foreign governments want to express their views, they can use their diplomats. #EndCorruptionNow Start by fixing the Swiss cheese definition of a “lobbyist.”  Require everyone who gets paid to influence government to register. And bring that lobbying out into the sunlight. Make every single meeting between a lobbyist and a public official a matter of public record. Third Big Change – End lobbying as we know it. #EndCorruptionNow Presidents should not be able to own companies on the side. And we shouldn’t have to beg candidates to let the American people see their financial interests. That should be the law – not just for presidential candidates, but for every candidate for every federal office. Second Big Change – Stop self-dealing by public officials. If a person works for the government, then that person should serve the public. No making policy decisions to help yourself instead of taxpayers. #EndCorruptionNow Ban elected and appointed officials from becoming lobbyists after they leave office. Not for 1 year.  Not for 2 years. For the rest of their lives. No special deals for millions and millions of dollars to the policymakers who will be in a position to pay back their old employers. First Big Change – Padlock the revolving door between big business and government. #EndCorruptionNow The problem is enormous – but we’ve dealt with enormous problems before. We just need some big reform ideas and a willingness to fight for real change. #EndCorruptionNow There’s no real question that the @realDonaldTrump era has given us the most nakedly corrupt leadership this nation has seen in our lifetimes. But they are not the cause of the rot – they’re just the biggest, stinkiest example of it. #EndCorruptionNow These reforms have one simple aim: to take power in Washington away from  the wealthy, the powerful, and the well-connected who have corrupted our  government and put power back in the hands of the American people.  #EndCorruptionNow Today, I’m introducing the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation proposed in Congress since Watergate. This is an aggressive set of reforms that would fundamentally change the way Washington does business. #EndCorruptionNow Our government systematically favors the rich over the poor, the donor class over the working class, the well-connected over the disconnected.  This is deliberate, and we need to call it for what it is – corruption, plain and simple. #EndCorruptionNow Corruption in Washington isn’t a small problem – and we can’t fight it with small solutions. I’m about to unveil my legislation to #EndCorruptionNow and put a stop to it once and for all. Watch live here: … Plenty of former lawmakers – Ds & Rs – have walked through giant loopholes in current law so they can do the work of lobbyists without having to register as one. It’s time to put a lock on the revolving door. #EndCorruptionNow … The same day SCOTUS announced they’d hear #JanusvAFSCME, Justice Gorsuch was schmoozing with anti-union funders @ Trump Hotel. He later voted to strip public sector unions of the resources they need to support workers. Real impartial, huh?#EndCorruptionNow … Wall Street fat cat turned Commerce Sec Wilbur Ross left $2 billion off his financial disclosure forms during his confirmation. Now @SecretaryRoss is under fire for possible insider trading & violating criminal conflict of interest laws. #EndCorruptionNow … I’ve been sharing examples of how corruption has seeped into Washington – and I’ve got a few more to add before I introduce sweeping new legislation to clean up our government and #EndCorruptionNow. You can watch live here at 10:00am: … Payday lenders don't just prey on the vulnerable and lobby @MickMulvaneyOMB. They've also been caught interfering in academic studies meant to convince lawmakers that payday loans aren’t harmful to consumers. #EndCorruptionNow … 4 months after @FCC Commissioner Meredith Baker voted to approve a huge merger between Comcast and NBC, she resigned. And you'll absolutely never guess where she went to work next! (It was Comcast-NBC.) #EndCorruptionNow … It’s no wonder @realDonaldTrump's drug pricing plan does nothing to actually reduce drug prices. It was developed by a former Big Pharma lobbyist, and it’s being run by HHS @SecAzar, a former Big Pharma executive. #EndCorruptionNow  … Corporations don't just lobby, they also produce “unbiased” “research” to sway lawmakers. One Brookings economist was forced to resign after authoring a study that attacked a consumer protection rule – & was funded by a financial firm.#EndCorruptionNow … Lobbying isn’t just for Big Banks, Big Pharma, & Big Oil anymore. Big Tech is in on the game too. Last year, @Amazon, @Apple, @Facebook, @Google and @Microsoft spent a combined $50 million lobbying Ds and Rs in the government. #EndCorruptionNow … I’ve been sharing examples of how corruption has seeped into Washington – and I’ve got a few more to add before I introduce sweeping new legislation to clean up our government and #EndCorruptionNow. You can watch live here at 10:00am: … Jared Kushner refused to divest from his holdings in Kushner Companies. Then he sucked up to executives from a big bank & investment company with personal White House visits. In return, they gave his family business $509 million in loans. #EndCorruptionNow … How much is it worth to a bank to send its people into gov't? At least $232M. That’s how much the #GOPTaxScam handed to @GoldmanSachs in the 1st quarter after it passed – and former exec/Trump adviser Gary Cohn helped sell it to Congress. #EndCorruptionNow … .@GoldmanSachs might as well change its name to “Government” Sachs. The bank has sent high-level execs (who leave with multi-million dollar gifts) into just about every D and R administration since FDR. And it keeps paying dividends. #EndCorruptionNow … Acting @EPA head Andrew Wheeler is just as dirty as his predecessor. He’s a former coal lobbyist who's working to poison the agency – and the environment he’s supposed to protect – from the inside. #EndCorruptionNow … I tried, but 280 characters can’t even begin to cover all of Scott Pruitt’s acts of corruption and ethics scandals. #EndCorruptionNow … I've been sharing examples of how corruption has seeped into Washington. It’s a long list. Tune in live at 10am tomorrow as I lay out my plan to change the way Washington does business and #EndCorruptionNow.  …pic.twitter.com/fg7NkIyHvR Washington’s revolving door is slick with oil money. @Exxonmobil had 29 registered lobbyists in 2016. 22 of them previously worked for Ds and Rs in the government. #EndCorruptionNow … Congress isn’t the only branch for sale. Justice Clarence Thomas attended a fancy Koch Brothers retreat, paid for by right-wing lawyers – & accidentally “omitted” his wife’s work as a lobbyist on his financial disclosures... for 6 years. #EndCorruptionNow … When former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost his seat, he went straight to Wall Street for a $3.4 million salary. Pretty sure he wasn't hired for his investment banker chops (because he has none). They wanted access and influence. #EndCorruptionNow … Tom Price was later forced to resign from @HHSGov – after spending close to $1 million of taxpayer money on flights. (Oh, and another Congressman was just indicted for insider trading over the stock for that same company.) #EndCorruptionNow … Former HHS Secretary Tom Price brazenly traded health care stock while in Congress, & misrepresented the value of his stocks on financial disclosures. When I asked him about it in a hearing he said he was “offended by the insinuation” that he did anything wrong. #EndCorruptionNowpic.twitter.com/vm4Fnherge Big Bank lobbyists have successfully chipped away at financial regulations, even when Democrats controlled the Senate and White House. Like in 2014, when @Citi slipped an amendment into a spending bill that reversed a key Dodd-Frank provision. #EndCorruptionNowpic.twitter.com/OBopKacax7 I know for a fact that @BetsyDeVosED is the worst – and most corrupt – Education Secretary ever, because I’ve actually done my homework. I launched #DeVosWatch to track all her scandals at @usedgov. #EndCorruptionNow … .@BetsyDeVosED has refused to divest from her secret family trusts, and filled the Education Department with #4profit college hacks who have given away the store to grifters and crooks at bogus #4profit colleges. #EndCorruptionNow … .@realDonaldTrump is running the most corrupt administration of our lifetimes. Tomorrow, I’ll unveil sweeping new legislation to clean up our government. Until then, I’ll be sharing examples of how corruption has seeped into Washington. It’s a long list. #EndCorruptionNow Corporations are making record profits & top execs are cashing in huge bonuses – but workers’ wages are flat. That's because too many companies shovel out cash to wealthy shareholders and ignore the big picture. I’ve got a bold new plan to change that. … 98 years ago today, the 19th Amendment was ratified. The women who won our suffrage were told over and over again to give up the fight. We have the vote today because they didn’t listen.pic.twitter.com/JcoKbb87xb The bomb that killed 40 children on a school bus in Yemen last week was sold to the Saudis by the US. This Administration must answer for our continued support of the Saudi-led campaign. … Next Tuesday, I’ll be speaking at @PressClubDC about my bold new plan to fundamentally change the way Washington does business. I’ll unveil sweeping anti-corruption legislation to eliminate the influence of money in federal government & ensure it works for working families again. … For decades, big companies have made record profits while wages for working families haven’t budged. It didn’t use to be this way. We built America's middle class after WWII. We can get back to the time when American companies & workers did well together. … .@KCCorp will dole out $700-900 million in stock buybacks to help shareholders & executives while cutting up to 5,500 jobs. @Kroger is closing 14 stores & laying off more than 1,600 people while rewarding its corporate execs & shareholders with $1.2 billion in stock buybacks. Let’s look at some individual companies: @WellsFargo got a $3.4 billion boost from the #GOPTaxScam. It turned around and announced plans to close 900 branches, while rewarding executives and shareholders with tens of billions of dollars in stock buybacks. The #GOPTaxScam showered more than a trillion dollars on big American  corporations – a huge windfall for wealthy shareholders and executives.  But workers have seen their real wages go DOWN. … My big new bill, the Accountable Capitalism Act, would restore the idea that big American companies should look out for their workers, not just their shareholders. Why do we need to pass this bill? Just look at what’s happened since the #GOPTaxScam passed. … A free and independent press is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. I stand by the @BostonGlobe’s efforts to defend the First Amendment from @realDonaldTrump’s attacks, and to pursue and report the truth. #FreePress … I talked with @JimCramer about my new bill to hold businesses accountable to their employees – not just their shareholders. It starts by giving workers at big companies the right to select 40 percent of the company's board members.pic.twitter.com/SzTsiqMkAC American taxpayers should not have to subsidize the abuse and exploitation of immigrants in private detention centers. @DHSgov has a legal and moral obligation to ensure that all people in their custody are treated with dignity and respect. … Over the last year, corporate profits have soared while average wages for Americans haven’t budged. It’s been the same sad story for decades. Today I’m introducing a new bill to help return to the time when American companies & workers did well together: … The US has been assisting Saudi Arabia's military strikes in Yemen for 3 years. Thousands of civilians have died. The American people deserve to know the full scope of our operations in Yemen so we can hold our partners – and ourselves – accountable. … #WhatsAtStake in the fight for the Supreme Court? If Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed, he could be the deciding vote to uphold @realDonaldTrump’s cruel and reckless immigration policies. #ImmigrantsAtStake Our veterans deserve the very best – and at the bare minimum, they deserve a VA free of corruption. Instead, @realDonaldTrump has handed the department to 3 of his Mar-a-Lago cronies who are completely unqualified & unaccountable to the public. I've called for an investigation. … The Trump Admin has decided that banks aren't part of the “financial services” industry, & that they should get an additional $2.5 billion in tax giveaways under the #GOPTaxScam. There’s no limit to what @realDonaldTrump will do to reward his rich buddies. … I helped set up a special office at the @CFPB to protect servicemembers, who are often targets of scams. Now @MickMulvaneyOMB is siding with predatory lenders over our military. It’s a shameful disservice to people who put their lives on the line for us. … Today we remember the lives lost following the deadly rally that occurred a year ago in Charlottesville, when a group of white nationalists came to a peaceful Virginia town seeking to use hate and division to incite violence against fair-minded, innocent civilians. Shady #4profit colleges scam students out of their futures, & @BetsyDeVosED is their biggest accomplice. She just issued a new rule that would ensure for-profits face NO consequences for graduating students with huge debts & no job prospects. Another big favor for industry hacks. … I met with local officials and first responders yesterday from Webster & Dudley to thank them for their work, and to talk about how we can get these towns back up and running after last week's tornado. Massachusetts is strong – and we’ll get through this by working together.pic.twitter.com/Ot9eGIigPm Mae was born with a serious lung disease that required a long hospitalization and a double transplant. Now, she and her family are working to protect Medicaid so kids like her have access to affordable care. I'm so proud to be in this fight with you, Mae. … After I asked @CommerceGov about their decision to grant tariff exemptions worth millions to a sanctioned Russian company, they suddenly reversed it. Begging the question – is @realDonaldTrump trying to help the US aluminum industry, or his pal Putin?  … My office found that Rusal America Corp – a subsidiary of a sanctioned company controlled by a Russian oligarch & Putin ally – got an exemption from @realDonaldTrump’s aluminum tariffs days after he met with Putin in Helsinki. I asked the Trump Admin why. … Tragically, the death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria is far higher than the official count. The federal gov't hasn't done enough to assist or force accountability. I’ve called for a bipartisan commission to investigate the Trump Admin’s response.  … … Isata worked hard to provide for her family back in Sierra Leone. She was fired – supposedly for asking for tips – after trying to organize a union. The rich & powerful seize every chance to crush working Americans with no accountability, while people like Isata pay the price. … Massachusetts has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the county & can serve as a model for the federal gov't to develop policies to keep schools safe. @RepKClark & I surveyed MA educators & have a series of recommendations for @BetsyDeVosED to help stop gun violence in schools. … The #PayGap doesn't just impact black women's take home pay—think about retirement, pensions, healthcare coverage & more. This impacts American families across the country. #BlackWomensEqualPayDay Wilbur Ross is a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself. He has shady ties to Russia and China, serious business conflicts, and a history of cheating people out of their homes. What else is @SecretaryRoss hiding? … Because of an error @WellsFargo made, 400 of its customers lost their homes. What’s the bank doing to make it right? Setting aside a few thousand dollars for each of the people affected. Pathetic. The execs who oversaw this – including CEO Tim Sloan – should be fired. … The Trump Admin's new tax form fits on a postcard –& still requires 6 additional forms. It won’t save you time or money. To make Tax Day easier & cheaper, Congress should pass my bill to let millions of Americans simply sign & return a pre-filled tax form.  … Powerful corporate interests have poured gigantic amounts of money into capturing our courts – and the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh is their reward. We need to #StopKavanaugh so Washington starts working for the people again.pic.twitter.com/AoXboL3RYh I’m leading 23 Senators in telling @SecretaryZinke that he must REJECT new mining claims within our national monuments--especially while @POTUS' attacks on public lands are being challenged in court.   New mining within the boundaries of a national monument is illegal.pic.twitter.com/KuKgvq6Oo7 Working families trying to save up for a better future lose billions of dollars a year because some brokers look out for their own financial interests instead of their clients’. The @SEC_News should take much stronger action to address this problem. … I’m calling for an investigation into whether @realDonaldTrump used tours of Air Force One as a perk for Mar-a-Lago club members. The American people deserve better than a president who uses taxpayer-funded government resources to feather his own nest. … Just ten years after the big banks wrecked our economy, their lobbyists are gearing up for another round of rolling back important regulations - even though the banks are making record profits. The level of greed is astounding. … .@realDonaldTrump couldn’t get the votes in Congress to sabotage health care – so he’s doing it all on his own. His new scheme will let insurers sell junk plans that charge people w/pre-existing conditions more & jack up costs for everyone else. … A federal judge just forced @fema to extend shelter to Puerto Rican evacuees until August 31. That’s great for many families across MA– but now FEMA must help them find long-term solutions. If they don’t, we should pass my bill to force FEMA to do its job. … Kathy Kraninger helped implement a policy to punish innocent young children – that is a moral stain that will follow her for the rest of her life. And that stain will follow any Senator who votes to give her a big promotion. Many kids are still separated and some of the kids who have been reunified aren't the same. One 5-year old boy asked his mom to breast feed him even though she hadn't nursed him in years. That's the legacy of the policy Kraninger helped carry out. … At OMB, Kraninger oversees the agencies that conducted child separations & she admitted to me that @OMBPress “has an extensive role” in managing immigration policy. A former official said it would be “shocking” if she wasn’t involved in child separations. … The Banking Cmte might vote tmrw on Kathy Kraninger’s nomination to head @CFPB. She has no experience fighting for consumers, but part of her current job was to help @realDonaldTrump tear kids away from their parents at the border. Will Republicans reward her w/a big promotion?pic.twitter.com/rv9t7nVhe3 I have a bill w/@RepCummings to combat the opioid crisis. The drug industry’s made billions in profits while pushing addictive medications & turning a blind eye to the consequences. Our bill holds CEOs at companies that fuel the epidemic accountable for their actions.pic.twitter.com/DXipkYXgLa We know 3D-printed guns are dangerous - we don’t need to wait for the NRA to give Republicans its blessing. Glad to see MA leading the fight to keep these untraceable weapons off our streets. … Average wages are flat since the Republicans passed their tax bill, but big business CEOs are raking in record-breaking multi-million dollar bonuses. This was a policy designed to help the rich get richer – and it’s working just as Republicans planned. … .@fred_guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed at Stoneman Douglas HS, is deeply concerned about 3D-printed plastic guns. Will Republicans have the courage to take action now before these guns flood the market?pic.twitter.com/WTNHG8WaX9 .@realDonaldTrump wants to go around Congress & hand $100 billion to his rich buddies on top of $1.5 trillion he gave away to billionaires & big corporations last year. DC works great if you’re rich & powerful. How about a gov't that works for everyone? … Congressman Ron Dellums was a progressive champion who fought for civil rights and for a government that works for the people. My deepest sympathies are with his family and loved ones. … I visited Puerto Rico in January & saw devastation. But the island was already being crushed by debt. As I said 6 months ago: PR needs help rebuilding, & that help must go to those who need it. That's why I have a new bill to provide a path to debt relief.pic.twitter.com/WH7dyNp5bh Too many women and girls who suffer from crippling endometriosis are told it’s all in their head. It's not. It's a serious health condition. We need to talk about it. We need to raise awareness and remove the stigma. We need to work together to study it & find a cure. … .@BetsyDeVosED and her team of #4profit college hacks are tearing down protections for students and taxpayers left and right so these garbage dump school executives can line their own pockets. This is corruption, plain and simple. … We can’t defeat the opioid crisis with empty words and half measures. I was with @RepCummings in Baltimore today to discuss our plan to provide $100 billion to beat the opioid epidemic the same way we tackled the HIV/AIDS epidemic. … I spent over 30 yrs teaching & studying markets, contracts, & bankruptcy. Figuring out how to level the playing field for working families has been my life's work. Glad to answer Qs from @JRubinBlogger about how I see America's biggest economic challenges. … Thank you to @SenWarren for coming to Baltimore today to discuss #healthcare and the devastating #OpioidEpidemic with myself, @RepCummings, @RepSarbanes and @MayorPugh50. This is a public health crisis. I’m grateful to have such strong partners joining me in the fight against it.pic.twitter.com/YZd0hVX9Mb Tech underpins 34% of jobs in Massachusetts. In 2017, 70% of tech leaders in #MA said they plan to increase workforce in the next 12 months. Repealing #NetNeutrality puts all of that in jeopardy. Today is the day the courts set for reunifying the families ripped apart by @realDonaldTrump’s administration. They still haven’t fixed the problem they created. The incompetence and inhumanity of this administration is staggering. … Four district courts and three courts of appeal have blocked @realDonaldTrump’s effort to ban transgender people from serving in our military. One year later, his ban is still discriminatory, unconstitutional, and doesn’t make America safer. #ProtectTransTroops … I stand with federal workers in Massachusetts and across the country. We’re wearing #RedForFeds today to protest @realDonaldTrump’s executive orders rolling back federal workers' rights.pic.twitter.com/aPXB5ilH4G Puerto Rico is trying to rebuild after Hurricane Maria, but it's being crushed by debt. @SenSanders & I have a new bill to give territories that have suffered a major crisis a route to comprehensive debt relief and a chance to get back on their feet. … Betsy DeVos just proposed a ‘policy’ that will devastate students cheated by sham for-profit colleges, making it nearly impossible to have a fraudulent loan cancelled. @BetsyDeVosEd is supposed to work for students, not for-profit shareholders. Revolting. … If Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court, he will help overturn Roe v. Wade. We can’t go back to the time of back alley abortions. It’s time for women (and friends of women) to raise their voices and help #StopKavanaugh. … Brett Kavanaugh was handpicked by right-wing billionaires to tilt the scales of justice in their favor. I'm joining @RevDrBarber & faith leaders to discuss how the rights of women, people of color, workers, LGBTQ Americans, & the poor will be at risk if we don't #StopKavanaugh. … 10 years after the financial crisis, lobbyists are flooding Congress & saying it’s safe to roll back the rules on big banks again. They're wrong. Tune in as I talk with @RealBankReform about why we need a stable financial system that works for everyone.  … Wages stay flat as rents rise. Parents struggle to put food on the table. Kids drink water laced with lead. Working people are under attack. I joined @UniteThePoor for a conversation about how we can fight to reclaim our government from the rich & powerful: … .@WellsFargo built its business around deceiving customers. A fancy PR campaign & expensive commercials won’t cut it – there needs to be real accountability. That starts by getting rid of current CEO, Tim Sloan, & all the execs who were in charge while these scams took place. … The @CFPB was set up 7 years ago today to help consumers – and that’s exactly what happened. It’s returned $12 billion to Americans who have been cheated. But it’s being attacked by @realDonaldTrump, @MickMulvaneyOMB and their cronies. Here’s why the @CFPB is worth fighting for:pic.twitter.com/IpJ26QH0sX Average wages are down since the beginning of the year, while the costs of health care, housing, and child care continue to rise.

If we don’t save the free and open internet, @AjitPaiFCC will turn the internet into a digital oligarchy that serves the wealthy few. Paul Ryan must schedule a vote in the House immediately. Kathy Kraninger has no experience in consumer protection – her background is in drafting budgets. She previously proposed a 23% cut to the @CFPB’s budget, but today couldn't say how she'd do it. Budget cuts will hurt Americans who get cheated – they deserve answers, not dodges.pic.twitter.com/SYMLkwKImr Innocent kids have been traumatized by the Trump Admin’s family separations.

Watch live: … .@CFPB nominee Kathy Kraninger still hasn’t provided a response to our letter w/ @senwarren about her role in the Admin’s family separation policy. Anyone involved in overseeing that disaster is not qualified for a promotion, much less to a job this important to working families. Trump and his allies have attacked Special Counsel Mueller, the integrity of his investigation, and our own intelligence community. They should listen to William Webster – who directed the FBI & CIA under President Reagan – and let Mueller do his job. … .@Novartis is trying to score publicity points by holding off on raising drug prices for 5 & a half months. But nothing is stopping them from jacking up prices again, because @realDonaldTrump still hasn’t taken any concrete action to lower costs. This is just another PR stunt. … Every Democrat on @SenateBanking has called on Chairman Crapo to postpone @CFPB nominee Kathy Kraninger’s confirmation hearing until she hands over important documents that will help us conduct proper oversight of her nomination. … Kathy Kraninger has zero experience that qualifies her to run the @CFPB. My new report details her career “highlights” – including oversight of agencies responsible for the Trump Admin's child separation policy & botched recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. … Every American who believes that our courts shouldn’t work only for the rich and powerful should speak out against Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination.

It’s time for Republicans to join Democratic efforts to defend our elections, enforce sanctions, & protect Mueller's investigation. … Once again, @realDonaldTrump takes to the international stage to embarrass America, undermine our institutions, weaken our alliances, & embrace a dictator. Russia interfered in our elections & attacked our democracy. Putin must be held accountable – not rewarded. Disgraceful. My heart goes out to the family and friends of Officer Michael Chesna, a military veteran, of @WeymouthPD who was killed in the line of duty today. We are with you, Weymouth. … My new investigation found that @realdonaldtrump’s lawyer Michael Cohen raked in millions selling access to the White House while secretly representing a drug company linked to a Russian oligarch. This stinks of corruption & raises more questions about Cohen’s shady foreign ties. … DOJ's criminal charges provide hard evidence that Russian intel agents attacked America to boost their favorite candidates, undermine others, and influence our elections. @realDonaldTrump, cancel your ridiculous Putin summit and get your butt on a plane back to the United States.

My new bill would place a $500 monthly cap on what families have to pay out-of-pocket for prescriptions. … .@realDonaldTrump still wants you to think drug companies will stop scamming Americans just because he asked. Gimme a break – @pfizer's delay of a price INCREASE is another meaningless stunt that won’t reduce costs for struggling families. … America is strongest when we work together with our allies – including the 28 NATO members who share our democratic values. Undermining NATO is a gift to Putin that @realDonaldTrump seems all too happy to give. Brett Kavanaugh opposed a ruling that upheld the ACA. If confirmed to the Supreme Court, he could vote to strike down protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Health care for millions of Americans: that’s #WhatsAtStake. … UPDATE: The Firefighter Cancer Registry Act was signed into law yesterday. #BostonsBravest and firefighters across the country put their lives on the line for us every day – we owe it to them to do everything we can to protect their health and safety. … There’s a lot to dislike about Brett Kavanaugh’s record – including his hostility toward consumers. He argued that the @CFPB – which has returned $12 billion to people who were cheated – is unconstitutional. The rights of consumers: that's #WhatsAtStake. … Trump wants to put Brett Kavanaugh on the SCOTUS –but he can’t do it without a Senate majority. It’s time to fight: … Brett Kavanaugh's record as a judge and lawyer is clear: hostile to health care for millions, opposed to the CFPB & corporate accountability, thinks Presidents like Trump are above the law – and conservatives are confident that he would overturn Roe v. Wade. I'll be voting no. .@realDonaldTrump, we need real policies to prevent drug companies from jacking up costs – like letting Medicare negotiate prices. You supported that during your campaign, then abandoned it after Big Pharma objected. Prescription drugs are too expensive, and your talk is cheap. … Every single judge on @realDonaldTrump’s short list for the Supreme Court has been pre-approved by right-wing extremists. They've shown their willingness to side with the wealthy & powerful over the rights of women, workers, voters, & minorities. But we're ready to fight back.pic.twitter.com/CBhSw91Y8K The Trump Administration ripped hundreds of children away from their parents long before announcing the "zero-tolerance" policy. Reuniting these families is just the first step in rebuilding an immigration system that reflects our values. … I'm back in Massachusetts after spending some time on the ground with our troops in Iraq and Kuwait. Our deployed military personnel put their lives on the line every day. I'm grateful to have celebrated Independence Day with them. … Andrew Wheeler may not have the same stink of blatant corruption as @EPAScottPruitt – but he’s just as dirty. The @EPA's new Acting Director is a former coal lobbyist who will work to poison the agency – and the environment he’s supposed to protect – from the inside. … It looks like 29 was the magic number. @EPAScottPruitt has finally resigned. The American people deserve a new EPA chief who’s focused on protecting our environment, instead of someone intent on doing the bidding of Big Oil donors while wasting taxpayer dollars. … Climate change denier @EPAScottPruitt has become the poster boy for corruption in Washington – repeatedly using his government office to benefit himself, his family, and his Big Oil buddies. He should have resigned 28 scandals ago. … I’m grateful to each of our servicemembers for the sacrifices they make to keep our country safe. And I’m honored to have celebrated this Independence Day with these brave men and women.pic.twitter.com/ljEjrTqIjy Our military support played a significant role in enabling the Iraqi Security Forces to retake their country – but only the Iraqis can do the hard work needed to rebuild and prevent extremist threats from reemerging.

We discussed Iraq's recent elections, our countries’ joint commitment to defeating ISIS and combating terrorism in the region, and our shared desire to build a better life for the Iraqi people.

Congratulations to @RaiseUPMA and the thousands of workers, organizers, and volunteers who have fought their hearts out for an MA economy that works for everyone! … The House GOP’s “opioid week” failed to address the crisis by providing adequate treatment funding. My bill with @SenWarren, The CARE Act, is supported by the entire House Dem leadership and 60+ Members, but the GOP blocked debate on it.  My heart goes out to the Capital Gazette. No journalist should have to duck bullets in the newsroom. No student should have to hide from an active shooter. No one should have to live in fear of being in the middle of the next mass shooting. This violence MUST end. .@nationalgridus got a huge windfall from the #GOPtaxscam – but the gas company is still squeezing its own employees. 1,100 union workers who were negotiating for better wages & health care coverage have been locked out of their jobs. @steelworkers, we’re with you in this fight.pic.twitter.com/d00Gb8I06b The fight for equal justice for ALL Americans – not just the rich and powerful – has only just begun.

AFSCME was a major blow to unions and working people, while further rigging the system for wealthy special interests. We must fight back against attempts by billionaires to upend an underlying principle of our democracy—the right to organize. … Corporate interests have been rigging the system against workers for decades – and the Supreme Court just handed those interests a huge victory in #Janus v.

While the Court ruled it’s legal, the American people still know it isn’t right. And together, we'll keep fighting against religious discrimination, xenophobia, & hate. (2/2) Last year, I joined hundreds of people at Logan Airport to protest @realDonaldTrump's Muslim ban. We believed that the courts would ultimately overturn it – because it didn’t make us any safer, and it clearly violated America’s core values. We were wrong. (1/2)pic.twitter.com/E0NigZxunc I believe that when a woman flees the only home she's ever known with her 4-year-old son and begs the United States of America for asylum, she deserves a fair hearing. I believe that every human being has worth. We must do better. I spoke with one woman from El Salvador at a CBP processing center. She  gave a policeman a drink of water, and the gangs came after her. She sold everything she had and fled with her 4-year-old son because their lives were in danger. Today, I'm in McAllen, TX. What I've witnessed here is truly disturbing. People are being held in cages – there's no other way to describe it. There are children by themselves. Mothers with young babies.

Thousands of kids have been ripped from their parents with no plan to reunite them. And now @realdonaldtrump wants to create new detention camps for families. Separating kids is unacceptable – but indefinite imprisonment of families is still cruel & inhumane. On #WorldRefugeeDay, we cannot ignore the humanitarian crisis happening on our border as desperate families flee violence & persecution.

Their only “crime”? Seeking refuge here in the US. This is immoral. This is un-American.

Tune in live as @RepCummings and I welcome @UniteThePoor to the Capitol for a powerfully important conversation on poverty in America: … In his campaign, @POTUS made bold promises about reducing drug prices. But @SenWarren and I are gravely concerned that the public has been misled, that his drug pricing proposal released last month breaks those promises, and would do little to reduce out-of-pocket drug costs. My full statement on President Trump’s meeting with Kim Jong Un:  …pic.twitter.com/Dk1LNOnMuM Jeff Sessions' move to deny asylum to women fleeing domestic violence does not reflect our country's true values.

Now, 12 governors – led by @MassGovernor Baker – have endorsed my bipartisan bill to end the confusion between states & the federal gov't, & fix our broken marijuana policy. … Our democracy is under attack – but not lost. Watch live as I talk with the @ACLU about how we’re fighting to save it:  … The Supreme Court’s decision to make it easier for Ohio to cross eligible voters off the rolls is a major step backwards for our democracy.

My new bipartisan bill is another key step to update our marijuana laws. No qualified scientist should have to struggle to conduct basic research on marijuana. Their findings could spur medical advances or counter the opioid epidemic. I'm introducing a new bill with @SenCoryGardner that could make it easier to study marijuana’s medical uses. No legitimate business should be blocked from basic banking services – but that’s exactly what’s happening to law-abiding marijuana businesses. My new bipartisan bill will help decrease the public safety risk that arises when these businesses are forced to operate in all-cash. No veteran with chronic pain, child with a rare disease, or person struggling with a terminal illness should be denied the treatment they need. Millions of Americans currently access medical marijuana under state law. My new bill with @SenCoryGardner will help protect them. No one should go to jail for a joint. But more Americans are arrested for marijuana possession than all violent crimes combined. And black Americans are nearly 4x more likely to be arrested for it than whites. My new bill will help put an end to this two-tiered justice system. By outlawing marijuana, the federal government puts communities of color, small businesses, & public health & safety at risk. My new bill with @SenCoryGardner will let states, territories, & tribes decide for themselves how to regulate marijuana – without federal interference. The federal government’s marijuana policies are broken, outdated, and disregard the rights of states like MA & CO that have taken their own thoughtful approaches. @SenCoryGardner and I are introducing new legislation to protect them.pic.twitter.com/ojciYHEbqr It’s time to reform American’s outdated marijuana policies.

Families are at risk of homelessness & a new hurricane season is about to begin – this can’t wait. … Let’s be clear: @realDonaldTrump's gag rule isn't about improving women’s health care. It's an attempt to control women and shut down Title X providers that offer critical reproductive care. It’s right-wing ideology disguised as health policy. … Car dealers are exempt from @CFPB oversight – and auto loan defaults just hit a 15-year high. That's not a coincidence. It's what happens when shady lending practices go unchecked. … Even as banks make record profits, their former banker buddies turned regulators are doing them favors by rolling back a rule that protects taxpayers from another bailout. This kind of corruption is common in @realDonaldTrump’s Washington. … Thousands of students were cheated by for-profit colleges, but @BetsyDeVosED wants to stop students from getting the full loan forgiveness they deserve. So, I called for an investigation. Now a federal judge has agreed with me & stopped her illegal scheme. … .@Walmart rakes in billions from the #GOPTaxScam and sends the profits straight to Wall Street, while many employees struggle to put food on the dinner table. These share buybacks are a perfect example of how our economy is rigged against working families. … In another example of weak enforcement that will harm our economy, the DOJ just approved the @Bayer-@MonsantoCo merger, placing enormous power in the hands of one agribusiness giant. This deal is a brutal blow to small & family farmers, as well as our food supply. … The official death count in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria is only 64.

But bank lobbyists are already asking Congress for another round of favors. Washington won't stop this cycle until the American people demand it. … President Trump’s wild back and forth with Kim Jong Un shows once again that he has no strategy. If @realdonaldtrump wants to demonstrate real leadership, he needs to develop a plan and commit to work towards a peaceful resolution with North Korea.

Congress should act to reverse this terrible decision. … For years, armies of bank lobbyists & executives have groaned about how financial rules are hurting them. But there's a big problem with their story – banks are making record profits.

Title X patients won't be able to learn about all their reproductive options – worsening health care disparities & reducing access to care. Title X provides birth control, cancer screenings & HIV tests to over 4M Americans. It doesn’t fund abortions & never has. But today, @realdonaldtrump will issue a “gag” rule that will stop Title X doctors from even talking to their patients about abortion-related services. … Creating fake accounts, cheating servicemembers, overcharging mortgage borrowers – and now altering documents to fake compliance with an anti-money laundering order. @WellsFargo needs to face some real consequences, and CEO Tim Sloan needs to be fired. … No matter how you dress it up, torture is torture.

This is a powerfully important conversation – I  hope you’ll join me in participating. #CBCDemandsJustice Even the Trump Administration has conceded that Iran is complying with the deal. Now @realdonaldtrump has pulled out without offering any real alternative to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Creating chaos and confusion isn’t a strategy – it’s a recipe for disaster.

I’ll visit @BHCHP today, where I’ll talk about my plan to tackle the opioid epidemic head-on by sending significant federal funds to local communities for treatment & investing in the science that will help us end this deadly crisis.  … The State Department needs a leader who will prioritize diplomacy. The current nominee, Mike Pompeo, has defended the use of torture, tried to undermine the Iran nuclear deal, and scapegoated Muslim Americans after the Boston Marathon bombing. I won’t vote to confirm him. Last year, I wrote to Ginnie Mae – a federal agency – & asked it to go after mortgage lenders who exploit veterans with shady mortgage refinances. Ginnie Mae just said it will crack down on 2 of the worst offenders.

In Beijing, I had candid discussions with Chinese officials about US-China relations, acknowledging both our shared interests and our areas of disagreement, including my concerns about China's treatment of human rights.

Republicans remain silent. I have something to say about that: … Defeating a public health epidemic like the opioid crisis isn't easy. It takes major resources, local control, & the courage to combat stigmas. But we know what needs to be done. We've come together before to save lives – it's time for us to do so again. … Just like HIV/AIDS, we should ensure that every single American who needs addiction treatment and support gets it, without delay. That’s how we end the opioid crisis – not with speeches, but with treatment. Our proposal isn't about public declarations and empty words. Just like HIV/AIDS, we need to provide communities that are battling the opioid epidemic every day with the funding and tools they so desperately need. The Ryan White CARE Act transformed how America treats HIV/AIDS. Congress must show the same political courage on opioids that our colleagues showed 30 years ago. @RepCummings and I propose a parallel approach for opioids – investing in research & in treatment at the local level. Thanks to the Ryan White CARE Act, over half a million people a year with HIV/AIDS receive vital services. The epidemic isn’t over – but now life-saving medications are available, new infections have plummeted, and science – rather than stigma – guides medical care. In 1990, Democrats and Republicans in Congress worked together to pass the bipartisan Ryan White CARE Act – named in honor of a teen from Indiana who was diagnosed with AIDS at age 13. The law transformed our approach to treatment and provided significant new funding. Three decades ago, an epidemic swept across our country, killing tens of thousands of people each year. Stigma prevented many from seeking treatment. Doctors and lawmakers alike were stumped on how to treat this rapidly evolving crisis. It wasn't opioids – it was HIV/AIDS. Politicians treat the opioid crisis like it's some new, intractable problem. It's not. 30 years ago, Congress passed a law to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic – and it worked. Today, @RepCummings and I call on Congress to pass a similar law for opioids. … Tom Hoenig – a top banking regulator & political Independent – said the #BankLobbyistAct makes a serious mistake by weakening capital standards for big banks.

By putting gender identity first, @realDonaldTrump undermines readiness and caters to extremists who don't respect the sacrifices of our troops. Shameful.

We've fought hard for it – and now we’re fighting for better, more affordable care for all. … .@SenWarren's bill would increase the affordability and reliability of health insurance plans on the #ACA marketplaces — Consumers Union,  @FamiliesUSA @Public_Citizen @HealthPolicyHub endorse it. #ProtectOurCare  We need Medicare for All, but as long as private health care continues to exist, they should meet the standards of our public health programs.

We can start by bringing the white supremacists who attacked DeAndre Harris in Charlottesville to justice. DeAndre Harris was severely beaten by white supremacists in Charlottesville. Were those men brought to justice? No. Instead, DeAndre was prosecuted for accidentally hitting a while supremacist with a flashlight. It's absolutely mind-boggling. The words above the Supreme Court read "Equal Justice Under Law" – and that's supposed to be the basic promise of our legal system. But the DeAndre Harris case shows us we still have a long way to go. … We need to hold our partners and allies accountable for using the weapons and resources we provide them.

But the Trump Admin wants to weaken it – and now corporate lobbyists have found a court willing to block it. … .@realDonaldTrump is floating trial balloons about derailing the Mueller investigation. Our GOP colleagues, particularly the leadership, have an obligation to our country to stand up now and make it clear that firing Mueller is a red line for our democracy that cannot be crossed. When they break the law, Wall Street execs should be trading in their pinstriped suits for orange jumpsuits.

If he won’t, he should be called immediately to testify under oath before my colleagues and me on the Senate Banking Committee. … Since assuming control of the @CFPB, @MickMulvaneyOMB has done favor after favor for payday lenders and the banking industry without any legal justification – and he won’t answer basic questions about his actions. … I’ve written to @MickMulvaneyOMB 9 times in the past 3 months with 125 questions about his shady actions at the @CFPB. He has refused to answer more than 100 of them. That’s unacceptable for a public official – the American people deserve answers. … Today the 25th District of New York, Congress, and the American people lost a fierce fighter.

I introduced the “Ending Too Big to Jail Act” to make sure executives who cheat their customers get hit with jail time – not raises. … .@WellsFargo is about to be sanctioned for running an auto insurance scam that cost Americans millions of dollars. I don’t think that sort of corporate management merits a raise for CEO Tim Sloan. … .@WellsFargo got a bigger handout from the GOP tax scam than any other company – and what does it do with this huge financial windfall? Turns around and hands $4.6 million to CEO Tim Sloan. … .@WellsFargo CEO Tim Sloan enabled the bank’s massive fake accounts scam, got rich off it, and helped cover it up. He should have been fired – instead, he just got a big, fat raise. … When the Senate passed the #BankLobbyistAct yesterday, the banks and their lobbyists won big.

We need more accountability – not less. … The American people aren’t going to stand by while big banks and giant corporations run this economy and this Congress for their own benefit. Soon – maybe not today, or next week, or even in the next election – but soon, they will demand a government that works for the people. I’m not giving up. We need real accountability for big banks – and the people who run them. I just introduced a new bill – the Ending Too Big to Jail Act – to help ensure bank executives are hauled out of their offices in handcuffs when they break the law. … Exactly ten years after the financial crisis began, the Senate has voted 67-31 to pass the #BankLobbyistAct and roll back important regulations on America’s biggest banks. We fought hard, but the big banks and their lobbyists won this round. Instead of working to #EndGunViolence – Republicans and Democrats came together today to deregulate the big banks and set the stage for another financial crash. Bankers are popping champagne because the #BankLobbyistAct just passed the Senate. Torture doesn’t just violate our values, it jeopardizes our nat'l security and puts our military at risk.

Here's a tip @SecretaryAcosta: You should withdraw this anti-worker rule right now. … Tune in live as I talk about a part of the #BankLobbyistAct that keeps me awake at night – the part that guts our ability to find and go after mortgage discrimination by exempting 85% of banks from reporting data about the loans they make. … These aren't “community banks” – these are huge financial institutions that wrecked out economy in 2008 & sucked down about $50 billion in taxpayer bailouts. The #BankLobbyistAct takes them off the watch list & puts us at risk for another financial crisis. … Zions Bancorporation got $1.4 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis. But last spring the CEO begged to be taken off the government watch list. He got his wish – the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @ZionsBank as your local community bank. Comerica Incorporated controls about $72 billion in assets today & has naming rights to a MLB stadium – but taxpayers spent $2.25 billion bailing it out during the 2008 financial crisis. And the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate @ComericaCares as if it were a tiny community bank. Huntington Bancshares Incorporated got $1.4 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis. But the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @Huntington_Bank as your local community bank. Regions Financial Corporation has about 1,500 branches and 1,900 ATMs. It also got $3.5 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 crash. If the #BankLobbyistAct passes, @askRegions could get the same level of federal oversight as a small community bank. Keycorp is doing pretty well these days – it made almost $1.3 billion last year. That’s a lot of growth since the 2008 crash, when it got $2.5 billion in taxpayer bailouts. But the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate KeyCorp as if it were a small community bank. Fifth Third Bancorp got $3.4 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis and has more than 1,100 branches. But if the #BankLobbyistAct passes, @fifththird could get the same amount of federal oversight as your local community bank. BB&T Corporation has over 2,000 branches across the country and controls $221 billion in assets. It received $3.13 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 crash. But the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @BBT as your neighborhood community bank. SunTrust Bank got $4.85B in taxpayer bailouts after the financial crisis. It’s recovered pretty well. It controls $206B in assets and has a MLB stadium named after it. But the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate @Suntrust as if it were a small community bank. The #BankLobbyistAct will roll back rules on 25 of America’s 40 biggest banks. Combined, they got nearly $50 billion in taxpayer bailouts after the 2008 financial crisis – and they’re back to making record profits. America's biggest banks crashed the economy and took billions in taxpayer bailouts. Today, they're making record profits. But they still want more and their wish list is in the #BankLobbyistAct, which the Senate plans to pass this week.

She's gone after protections for victims of sexual assault, LGBTQ students, and students of color. … You'll be shocked to hear that @BetsyDeVosED's 1st year at @usedgov was a total failure. Instead of supporting students & teachers, she's been working to make life easier for student loan companies & her friends in the predatory #4profit college industry. … .@BetsyDeVosEd should be able to answer basic questions about the public school system. A year into her term as Secretary of Education, @RepKClark and I thought it was time for a report card: … If you have any doubt that @BetsyDeVosED is completely unqualified to run the Department of Education – you should take a look at her recent interview with @60minutes. … Do you think Congress should relax the rules on the big banks that got bailed out by taxpayers?

We can’t go back to a world where the banks run wild and families like the Estradas are left holding the bag.pic.twitter.com/ULpd6I7Yqv Today @BetsyDeVosEd told state governments they can't hold student loan companies accountable when they break state law. The Senate could stand up for students and block her move with my amendment to the #BankLobbyistAct. … History is repeating itself with the #BankLobbyistAct, as Republicans and Democrats prepare to vote to roll back regulations on big banks. Don't you think we should have learned our lesson by now? … In the late 1990s, Senator Paul Wellstone tried to warn Congress against rolling back major federal regulations on banks. His colleagues didn't listen. They repealed Glass-Steagall and set the stage for the 2008 financial crisis.pic.twitter.com/qRQHpShlvT ICYMI: @SenateDems met with yesterday with survivors—including a student and parent from Parkland, FL—families, and law enforcement on how we can strengthen our gun laws.

So when THEY say the #BankLobbyistAct "will make the financial system more vulnerable in a panic" by gutting big bank rules, you know it's time to oppose the bill. … The people of Massachusetts didn’t send me to the Senate to fight for big banks. They sent me here to fight for them. And so long as I am privileged to hold this job, that’s exactly what I’m going to do. I have to call it like I see it. And the truth is the #BankLobbyistAct is a giant gift to the big banks that could put us on track for another financial crash and hurt America’s working families. Calling out members of my own party who are supporting the #BankLobbyistAct doesn’t make me the most popular kid on the team. But that's not why I ran for the Senate. … 2006: This CEO says it's safe to deregulate his big bank. 2008: He's proven wrong when his bank gets $1.4B taxpayer bailout. 2017: He's back lobbying Congress to deregulate again. This week: A bunch of Senators side with him over taxpayers by voting for the #BankLobbyistAct.pic.twitter.com/UmcYLgf2DZ If we're going to vote on the #BankLobbyistAct – we should vote on each of these amendments so the American people know whose side their senators are on: Working families or big banks. 17. Amend Section 401 of the #BankLobbyistAct so it doesn't provide big banks with the giant legal loophole they need to challenge how the Fed regulates them. … 16.

And tragedies like this should never happen. … Happy #GalentinesDay to all the women of the U.S. Senate!pic.twitter.com/24in3nsIju The big banks & payday lenders that funded @MickMulvaneyOMB’s campaigns are doing cartwheels over @CFPB’s new strategic plan. Mulvaney wants the agency to stand up for big banks and scammers instead of holding them accountable when they cheat consumers. … The Senate can act TODAY & help give #Dreamers a path to become citizens of the only nation they call home. We’re ready to get this done.pic.twitter.com/aV3urMSlL6 America’s infrastructure is broken. But instead of making real investments to fix it, @realdonaldtrump wants to pass the burden on to local governments & let private companies make up the difference. Americans want safer roads & bridges – not higher tolls. … Equifax must clarify its confusing and incomplete story of the #EquifaxBreach. We've got to keep the heat on @Equifax & we need better laws to hold credit reporting agencies accountable: … My investigation revealed the depth of the breach and cover-up at @Equifax. And since I published the report, Equifax has confirmed it is even worse than they told us. … In October, when I asked the CEO about the precise extent of the breach, he couldn’t give me a straight answer. So for five months, I investigated it myself. … When hackers accessed the sensitive data of 145 million Americans, @Equifax let weeks go by before notifying the millions at risk. And that was just the beginning of the nightmare. … Marvin Goodfriend doesn’t support government-backed mortgages – which have made home ownership possible for millions of Americans. His views range from wacky to dangerous & the Senate should reject his nomination. … Every Republican on the Banking Committee supports Marvin Goodfriend’s nomination to join the Federal Reserve. This is the guy who wants to slap a magnetic tracking strip on dollar bills and make you pay a tax if you keep cash for too long. Seriously. … Last year, I called out shady mortgage lenders who exploit veterans for profit, and the federal agencies in charge created a task force to address the issue. Now those lenders have been put on notice: Cut it out, or you’ll be cut off.  …pic.twitter.com/SdJdIPEADx Dreamers like Staisy – a college graduate, ABA therapist for children, and aunt to an adorable little boy – should not have to live in fear of being separated from their families and friends. Time is running out for Staisy and 800k Dreamers. Congress must pass the #DreamActNow.pic.twitter.com/9zZA8uLB9P It was a challenge to find affordable child care for my own kids – it's even harder for parents today. So I fought to get more child care funding in this budget. Today, that work paid off when the Senate took a real step towards doubling child care funding for the next 2 years.pic.twitter.com/SVHUNXT7WL Watch Valeria’s story and you’ll see – Dreamers are woven into the fabric of our country. They’re students, doctors, nurses, firefighters. And they belong here. #DreamActNowpic.twitter.com/RrdISyI9Ga The more you look at the details of the #EquifaxBreach, the worse it gets. Congress needs to pass the bill I introduced with @MarkWarner to impose tough penalties on credit bureaus like @Equifax when they compromise our data. … According to its own policies, @Equifax was supposed to let people know if their info was hacked. But they only notified 2.5 million. Everyone else had to go to a website that was easily spoofed and put people's data in even greater danger. #EquifaxBreachpic.twitter.com/cBR9c5NsRX Despite its many security failures, @Equifax used a loophole to get a big contract from the IRS after the breach. It then raised its prices – cheating American taxpayers out of millions of dollars. #EquifaxBreachpic.twitter.com/xupIwcWe8g Hackers didn’t just get a glimpse at the data of millions of Americans – they stole it from @Equifax’s system and could have access to it forever. #EquifaxBreachpic.twitter.com/TpgS5lMAk0 It’s clear that @MickMulvaneyOMB isn’t interested in protecting consumers from the next #EquifaxBreach – but I am. That’s why I launched an investigation into the breach 5 months ago. Here’s what I found. (The details are worse than you think.) … One year ago, I went to the Senate floor to oppose the nomination of Jeff Sessions to lead @TheJusticeDept. Today I'm going back to the floor to talk about his continued attacks on civil rights, immigration & criminal justice reform as AG. Watch live:  … Diana is a graduate of Harvard Divinity School and her brother is a PhD student studying pancreatic cancer. They've both worked hard and played by the rules. We cannot tear apart families like Diana’s. We need to pass a #DreamActNow.pic.twitter.com/cVEj6lSvCR The @USDOL's Inspector General is now reviewing @realDonaldTrump's shady effort to reverse a rule letting tipped workers keep their earnings. Good. The least that @USDOL can do is freeze its efforts to steal workers' tips while the IG investigates what they were trying to hide. … We can’t rely on bought-and-paid-for @MickMulvaneyOMB to do anything about @Equifax. Congress needs to take action – like passing the bill @markwarner & I introduced to ensure there are severe, automatic penalties for credit bureaus that expose your data. … For months, @MickMulvaneyOMB has tried to use the @CFPB to coddle the  payday lenders and banks that have financed his political career. … Another middle finger from @MickMulvaneyOMB to consumers: he’s killed the @CFPB’s probe into the #EquifaxBreach that affected more than 145 million Americans.   .@realDonaldTrump has filled our top economic jobs with people obsessed with sucking up to Wall Street, & today is Yellen’s last day at the Fed. Tomorrow, her replacement will face a choice: show the same kind of courage – or own the next financial crisis. … The massive fraud at Wells Fargo showed the whole country that we need more accountability on Wall Street. But for more than a year, we've watched as @realDonaldTrump and his government have raced to turn the big banks loose again to once again threaten our whole economy. Chair Yellen’s decision today to freeze the growth of Wells Fargo until it shapes up also demonstrates that we have the tools to rein in Wall Street – if our regulators have the guts to use them. This one hits them where it hurts. Fines alone will never rein in fraudulent behavior at the big banks. We need tough penalties that affect the actual lives of the people who run the banks. By pushing out Board Members at Wells Fargo, Chair Yellen sent a strong message. … For months, I have repeatedly pressed Janet Yellen to hold Wells Fargo accountable for its fake accounts scam and push out responsible Board Members. Today she did it – in her last act as Fed Chair.pic.twitter.com/ebIkhu8R0a .@realDonaldTrump just released his new nuclear strategy, which calls for more nuclear weapons that are easier to use. This flies in the face of decades of American leadership in building a safer world – one with fewer nuclear weapons. #NuclearPostureReviewpic.twitter.com/cU7jzlT96h This week @GOPHELP released a paper that argues for gutting accountability for shady #4profit colleges – like cheating students is no big deal. I don’t know about you – but I think that’s ridiculous. Judge for yourself:pic.twitter.com/BPaevPh3Hs The only thing shocking about the GOP's partisan memo is the contempt its release shows for the rule of law & American national security. Russia is still trying to undermine our democracy – until this government starts putting this country ahead of politics, we are all at risk. Want to hear something outrageous? @USDOL buried a study on the Trump Admin's plan to make it harder for tipped workers to earn a living - because the data showed it would cost workers billions. The Admin must release the study & end its assault on workers. … America has been a global leader in science and technology for decades – but we’re slipping. To stay on the cutting edge, we have to make the right investments in basic research, STEM education, medicine, & clean energy. … Payday lenders contributed over $60k to @MickMulvaneyOMB’s political campaigns. Now at the CFPB, Mulvaney is protecting predatory lenders instead of consumers. @RepMaxineWaters & I want to know if that’s more than coincidence.pic.twitter.com/0TdCDBkwSR .@RepJoeKennedy is one of the most compassionate, strongest voices fighting for an America that works for everybody. He did a great job last night – watch his Democratic response to the State of the Union:  … My thoughts are with my Republican colleagues and all those involved in the tragic train crash in Virginia today. … Meet my guest for the #SOTU: Jean Bradley Derenoncourt. A Haitian immigrant, public servant, and proud American.pic.twitter.com/FrmwD16djw Honored that Jean Bradley Derenoncourt will be my #SOTU guest. He immigrated to Brockton from Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, became a citizen & the first Haitian-American man elected in MA. He embodies American values of hard work, service, & persistence. … The GOP bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks would force women with severe health issues to stay pregnant until their lives are endangered, and force those with unviable fetuses to carry to term. This bill is dangerous and cruel – we cannot let it pass. #NoAbortionBan Today, the Senate will vote on a bill to ban all abortions after 20 weeks, with limited exceptions. Only 1% of abortions take place at 21 weeks or later – and the reasons are heartbreaking. We’re still defending women’s reproductive rights 45 years after #RoevWade. Why? Because politicians who’ve never been pregnant and had to make these gut-wrenching decisions want to score political points at the expense of women and their families. Elias, Madelyn, & Ledys came to the US as children, and built lives out of hard work and hope. But time is running out for them and 800,000 Dreamers. Congress must pass the #DreamActNow. … “The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference." Today as we remember the horrors of the Holocaust and the six million Jews murdered by the Nazi regime, I think of Elie Wiesel's words. We must actively resist hate and bigotry in all its forms. #WeRemember By ending DACA, @realdonaldtrump subjected 800k Dreamers to deportation. Now he wants to hold them hostage to Steven Miller’s anti-immigrant wish list. It’s insulting. We already have a bipartisan solution to the Trump-created crisis: it’s called the Dream Act. #DreamActNow The problem with NAFTA is simple: it was designed to work well for corporations instead of people. But we have a chance to rewrite the rules to benefit American workers and brings jobs back to the United States – we should take it. … The way people pay for health care in America still puts all but the richest among us at risk. It’s time to demand a health care system that works for all of us. Tune in live as I speak at the @FamiliesUSA Health Action Conference.  … When @realdonaldtrump ran for president he said marijuana policies should be left up to states. He should stick to his word and let states implement their own regulations – upending them only creates confusion, and puts our public health & safety at risk. … New HHS Secretary – same story. In the ways that matter most to working families, Alex Azar is just like Tom Price. He’ll support efforts to repeal the ACA, get fewer people covered, and gut Medicaid. The American people deserve better.pic.twitter.com/s5rzVXet5Q Why are Democrats helping Donald Trump and the GOP deregulate banks that got nearly $50 billion in taxpayer bailouts? #BankLobbyistsAct  We need a Fed Chair who will stand up to Wall Street and fight for working families.

That person is not Jerome Powell.pic.twitter.com/sItevBbxDD Congratulations, @SenDuckworth! … STARTING NOW: The #MedicareForAll National Town Hall is live from Washington. It's time to make health care a right.  … Puerto Rico isn't in the headlines anymore. But the need for recovery funding is no less urgent than it was four months ago.

The Republicans refused to fix any of these issues– and they still haven't fixed them. We don't need new promises. We need new laws.

That's why we're in this #TrumpShutdown.pic.twitter.com/cYEuso8nXD The GOP controls every branch of govt. I repeat: They control the WH & Congress. They've lurched from crisis to crisis for months w/o funding disaster recovery, health centers or children's health care. All while Dreamers hang in the balance. This is no way to govern. The Senate must act to protect our Dreamers from @realDonaldTrump's racist, anti-immigrant agenda. #DreamActNowpic.twitter.com/IQaao6Gspr The US should not be in the business of warrantless, dragnet surveillance of American citizens. But Section 702 of FISA allows our gov’t to do just that. I voted no on a bill to reauthorize Section 702 without important protections for Ameicans' privacy. … To impugn @SenatorDurbin's integrity is disgraceful. Whether you agree with him on the issues or not, he is one of the most honorable members of the Senate. The Senate should reject S. 139 and refuse to reauthorize Section 702 without real reforms to defend our right to privacy while protecting our nation. … The day after we honor MLK Jr., the Senate will vote on whether to reauthorize a program that would allow intelligence agencies to continue spying on Americans without meaningful oversight or critical protections for Americans’ privacy. As we remember MLK Jr.’s legacy this weekend, we cannot forget that he was a victim of warrantless spying by the US government. The US has a long track record of secretly monitoring civil rights activists & others who dared to stand up for their rights. … I was in #PuertoRico today with the MA delegation to see what can be done to help recovery efforts. It was clear that the road to recovery is long & we're not moving fast enough. US citizens are suffering. We must do more to help, and we need to do it now. … Eight years ago today, Joe Freddy Francois was a child in Haiti when the earthquake hit. Six years later he graduated as high school valedictorian. The character of this nation is not the character of its president. It is the character of its people. … I could call @realDonaldTrump’s comments racist, vile and disgusting because that is what they are. But I also want to tell you about Joe Freddy Francois because immigrants from Haiti, Africa and everywhere else are an integral part of the American fabric. I’m fighting for Washington to work better for our veterans and all working families. Let’s pass the Protecting Veterans from Predatory Lending Act and give our vets more financial security. Right now, some shady lenders can pocket huge fees by pushing veterans to refinance their VA mortgages - even when the vets end up losing money on the deal. Our bill puts a stop to that. I’m glad to partner with @SenThomTillis on a new bipartisan bill to crack down on lenders who are trying to exploit our veterans.pic.twitter.com/jZ6uMEdrxR Responsible nations stick to their agreements – and @realDonaldTrump should stick to the #IranDeal to keep our country safe. The Iranian regime supports terror, abuses human rights, & develops ballistic missiles. The worst thing we could do is make it easier for Iran to get its hands on a nuclear weapon. This week, @realdonaldtrump faces a choice: keep the #IranDeal intact, or re-impose nuclear sanctions that would violate the agreement and make it easier for Iran to get a nuclear bomb. Since 2015, the #IranDeal has blocked Iran’s path to a nuclear bomb. So far, the deal is working. But @realdonaldtrump’s refusal to recertify it could change that. .@SenWarren on The Data Breach Prevention and Compensation Act: "Here's the deal— it actually turns out that Equifax may actually make money off the breach." #SpecialReportpic.twitter.com/GSvf7Dz0DC Here’s the basic problem in Washington. Big business lobbyists are so used to running the place that they label anyone willing to stand up to them as extreme. When Tom Donohue and the @USChamber attack me for standing up to corporate interests, I know I’m doing my job. Earlier today I introduced a bill to hold big companies like Equifax accountable to consumers.  Then millionaire lobbyist Tom Donohue who runs the @USChamber called me an extremist. Massive data breaches like the Equifax hack cannot be the new normal. Introduced a bill with @SenWarren today to penalize companies that fail to protect your private data from hackers.pic.twitter.com/bxDEvInxWz If we want @Equifax and other credit reporting agencies to act responsibly with our data, we need to hold them accountable when they screw up. … Had this law been in place during the Equifax breach, the company would have had to pay at least $1.5 billion in fines – half of which would have gone straight back to affected consumers. Instead, @Equifax likely made money off the hack. Today @MarkWarner and I introduced a new bill that would impose massive, mandatory penalties when companies like @Equifax expose millions of Americans’ personal information.pic.twitter.com/GTugkoudIw UPDATE: The Jobs for Heroes Act – a bipartisan effort to help veterans get jobs – got signed into law yesterday! Glad to team up with my Republican colleagues on this good idea. Alex Azar wants to smile and pretend he’s different from @realDonaldTrump’s last HHS Secretary, Tom Price. But I don’t see the difference. They both want to tear down Medicaid. #SayNoToAzarpic.twitter.com/6jvJYkgVJl States have the right to enforce their own marijuana policies – and I’m working on legislation to make sure it stays that way.

When mayors ring the alarm bell, we need to listen.pic.twitter.com/ghp1zrnJrZ When corporations file for bankruptcy, they shouldn’t be able to cherry-pick courts that they think will rule in their favor. That's why @JohnCornyn and I introduced a bill to prevent big companies from manipulating the bankruptcy system. … Congress should act now to pass the SECURE Act and provide qualified TPS  recipients with access to legal permanent residency. Many Salvadorans, Haitians & Nicaraguans have lived, worked and paid taxes in the US  for decades. This is their home. We must #SaveTPS. The Trump Admin’s use of TPS to initiate wholesale deportations is fundamentally wrong. These actions do not make America stronger or safer - they weaken our economy and our communities. First, the Trump Admin ended Temporary Protected Status for 2,500 Nicaraguans. Then, nearly 60,000 Haitians. Today, @realdonaldtrump crossed another item off his anti-immigrant agenda by terminating TPS for 200,000 Salvadorans. Dreamers aren’t bargaining chips. They aren’t pawns in @realDonaldTrump’s game. We made a promise. We said come out of the shadows & be fully woven into the fabric of America because that’s who you are. In America, we work hard & dream big & we must keep our promise to Dreamers. Congress needs to take immediate action to protect state marijuana laws, and the patients that rely on them.

And I will promise you this: When it does, the politicians who lead this Congress & voted for this tax heist will be held accountable for turning their backs on the American people. Americans are angry. And they are right to be angry. Over & over, again & again, they watch this Congress ignore their problems while jumping to do more favors for billionaires, giant companies, & campaign donors. The bill that the Republicans jammed through the Senate tonight isn’t tax reform. It’s a heist.

A majority of Americans support this bipartisan bill. So what the heck are you waiting for, @SenateMajLdr? Let’s do this RIGHT NOW. Big banks sucked down almost $70B in taxpayer bailouts just a few years ago – and now the @HouseGOP want to turn them loose all over again. No Democrat that claims to support working families should join the GOP in supporting this bill. … While the @HouseGOP are set to vote tomorrow on the #GOPTaxScam, they're also gearing up to vote on a bill that would roll back the rules on dozens of the biggest banks in the country.

That’s why I will be voting against these judicial nominees, & I urge my colleagues to do the same. This week, the GOP Senate will vote on Steven Grasz, Donny Willett, & James Ho to sit on the federal courts of appeals. The records of all 3 nominees show that they will favor powerful interests over workers, women, LGBTQ individuals, people of color, & religious minorities. Now that there’s a GOP President who’s committed to tilting our courts further in favor of the rich & the powerful, Republicans are looking to fill our courts with judges who share that commitment. For years, the GOP have worked hand-in-hand with billionaire-funded right-wing groups to ensure that our courts advance the interests of the wealthy & powerful over those of everybody else. Are you really trying to bully, intimidate and slut-shame @SenGillibrand? Do you know who you're picking a fight with? Good luck with that, @realDonaldTrump. Nevertheless, #shepersisted. … The American people deserve to know how this #GOPTaxScam will impact the economy and how it will affect middle-class families. @USTreasury promised an economic analysis – but this isn’t it. I look forward to the IG’s investigation providing real answers for American families. To recap: After claiming repeatedly he had projections showing the #GOPTaxScam paid for itself, Mnuchin released a report showing that there were no such projections, and that even his own wildly optimistic made-up projections weren’t enough for the plan to pay for itself. Where does the other half of the growth come from according to @USTreasury? Partly from proposals that haven’t even been introduced in Congress and may never happen.pic.twitter.com/aZpZlfdcgX But it’s worse: even Mnuchin’s made-up numbers on the corporate tax changes only get Republicans halfway to the economic growth numbers they’re claiming. Mnuchin’s projection is completely out of line with other projections. It's way higher than credible estimates, and even higher than right-wing projections that ignore the effect of the national debt on growth.pic.twitter.com/7C6KCIWwOB
