Support @bam4kansas for Kansas Secretary of State:  The former US Ambassador to South Africa says it well here: … Absolutely disgraceful that the president continues to target African nations and spread racially-charged claims that have no basis in evidence or fact. … As the Trump administration retreats from American commitments to be a leader in addressing the problem, signs the climate chsnge crisis is growing continue to be seen all over the earth. … President Trump falsely claimed that his ex-lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are "not a crime."  They are, in fact, felonies.   … National security advisor:  GUILTY.   Foreign policy advisor:  GUILTY.   Personal attorney:  GUILTY.   Deputy campaign chair:  GUILTY.   Campaign chair:  GUILTY. Corporate greed looks like drug company CEO Bob Hugin.   Hugin raised the price of his cancer drug three times in one year when he knew patients had no choice but to pay. Hugin made millions, and cancer patients paid the price.   Bob Hugin will never be on our side.pic.twitter.com/Q1Q75d7LIW Trump's longtime personal lawyer Cohen: Guilty.  Trump's former campaign chairman Manafort: Guilty.  It's no coincidence Trump chose a Supreme Court nominee who doesn't believe a president can be criminally indicted.   The Senate needs to pause the Kavanaugh hearings immediately. Trump's personal lawyer has sworn under oath that POTUS directed him to commit a federal crime.  The Senate must reject any SCOTUS nominee from a president who is an alleged criminal co-conspirator—especially when that nominee may rule to protect Trump from any accountability.

It’s a fact that Russia attacked our democracy in 2016 to influence the presidential election in favor of Trump.

There must be Americans in the room. If the President won't make Russia's attack on our election the #1 issue at the summit, then it should be canceled. Ahead of their private meeting, Pres. Trump should know that Putin is going to lie to his face. Our President should take the word of our dedicated law enforcement officers over that of a former KGB officer. He needs to put America first and stop undermining this investigation. 12 Russian intel officers were just charged with interfering in an American election.    @POTUS needs to step up to the plate and be tougher than asking the Russians to stop. If he can’t, he absolutely should not be meeting with Putin. … Russia attacked our American democracy to interfere with our elections. This isn’t a hoax and the Special Counsel’s investigation is not a witch hunt. It has produced results w/ more indictments today and must continue.

The Russian government carried out malicious attacks on our 2016 presidential election and our democracy. The threat continues as today’s Indictments show.   Trump should cancel Monday’s summit with Putin. If he doesn’t and fails to confront Putin it’s Presidential malpractice.

There's a reason we don't let defendants, or prosecutors, select the judge to preside over their case or the appellate justices who will review their case. Society demands & expects the judiciary to be impartial. That is no longer true in this instance. … Senator @CoryBooker at weekly Dem press conference: “POTUS shouldn’t be above the law, shouldn’t be able to pick the judge that will preside over questions involving this investigation . It’s common sense” #WhatsAtStake #StopKavanaugh The nomination of Judge Kavanaugh would put our nation's heath care system in danger. More from Sens Klobuchar, Hirono & Booker, LIVE:  … #WhatsAtStake #StopKavanaughpic.twitter.com/Pn0un8HqnB So far, the special counsel has produced 76 criminal charges, 5 guilty pleas & 1 person sentenced. Trump’s campaign manager is also in jail.  Trump nominated the 1 judge to #SCOTUS who believes a sitting president shouldn't be subject to criminal investigations.  #StopKavanaughpic.twitter.com/qnocwQnLm4 Senator @corybooker with @RAICESTEXAS @JoaquinCastrotx on family separation, way forward: “This is moral vandalism.

If Kavanaugh is confirmed, we could see progress rolled back on many issues including the right of women to make their own medical decisions, voting rights, rights of workers to organize for better wages & working conditions, the principle of equal justice under the law & more. We need to get money out of politics & end the corrosive effect that dark money & corporate donations continue to have on our democracy—but Kavanaugh's record suggests he will side with corporations and uphold our existing broken campaign finance laws. President Trump has been crystal clear about his intent to only nominate justices that support overturning #RoevWade—there’s no question Kavanaugh meets this litmus test. Kavanaugh has a demonstrated hostility toward provisions of the Affordable Care Act—protections for those with pre-existing conditions, minimum standards for insurance, coverage for routine care like birth control & breast cancer screenings are all on the line. Kavanaugh has worked to undermine the @CFPB’s power & its efforts to protect consumers from predatory lenders & bad corporate actors. Kavanaugh has shown a willingness to overturn common sense protections against gun violence, such as assault weapons bans & other measures. In recent years, a narrowly divided Supreme Court has shown hostility toward labor unions & the right of workers to organize for better wages & working conditions—Kavanaugh’s decisions have favored corporations over workers & he will likely continue this troubling trend. Kavanaugh has a long track record of working to undermine the @EPA & laws that protect our environment from big polluters. I'm going to do everything I can to stop Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination—but there are also strong reasons why this president shouldn't be able to nominate, nor should the Senate even debate a nominee at this time. We can’t underscore enough the fact that @realDonaldTrump is a subject of an ongoing criminal investigation & there's a clear conflict of interest for this president—who has a history of demanding loyalty tests—to name a justice to the court that could be involved. The Supreme Court could eventually end up issuing a decision on whether a sitting president can pardon himself or be criminally indicted—President Trump should not be able to nominate a justice to that court while his own investigation is ongoing. Kavanaugh has written extensively on his beliefs that a sitting president shouldn't be subject to criminal investigations or civil lawsuits—this all but assures he would work to shield Trump from any litigation or criminal proceeding related to the special counsel's investigation We’re also in an critical election year & according to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s own rule that Supreme Court nominations should only proceed after elections, the Senate should wait to debate any nominee until after the American people have spoken in November. There are many reasons why this #SCOTUS nominee shouldn't move forward—now we need to fight & make our voices heard. Call Republican senators & demand they reject this nomination: 202-224-3121. Remember: “The power of the people is always greater than the people in power.” "President Trump has told us what he wants to do. He wants to roll back worker's rights, civil rights, women's rights.

"I'm well on the record already with saying that, before it was even Kavanaugh, that this is a very problematic constitutional moment for this country," he tells @JudyWoodruff.pic.twitter.com/NySiW2PUwO Just interviewed Senator @CoryBooker. Here’s what he had to say about Kavanaugh. #SCOTUSNominationpic.twitter.com/BgNvMsUMOO The fact that Kavanaugh believes that a President should not be subject to civil litigation or criminal investigation while in office means that Trump just nominated a justice who has already reached conclusions on these serious questions. That should raise enormous red flags. President Trump is currently a subject of an ongoing criminal investigation—there is a clear conflict of interest inherent in the President nominating someone who could be the deciding vote on a number of potential issues from that investigation that could come before the Court. Here’s what’s at stake with Kavanaugh on the Court: the rights of women to make their own medical decisions; the rights of Americans to quality, affordable healthcare; civil rights; voting rights; the rights of workers to organize for better wages & working conditions; & more. #Happy4thofJuly! As we celebrate & rejoice in America’s blessings, let’s also take a moment to reflect on the fact that we in this country are inheritors of a great legacy. We owe a debt for our freedoms that we can’t pay back—we have an obligation to pay it forward. A restaurant server and single mom making $2 an hour.

The investigation must conclude before considering any nominations.  For that reason, I do not believe the Judiciary Committee should or can in good conscience consider a nominee put forward by this President until that investigation is concluded. 5/5 Should we be considering a Supreme Court nominee from a President who has a history of demanding these loyalty tests and could be responsible for participating in something that could undermine the Mueller investigation?  My answer is, no. 4/ We’ve seen numerous people that are close to the President or on his campaign who have plead guilty … and we have a President who in the past seemed to ask people for loyalty tests. 3/ The President of the United States is a subject of an ongoing criminal investigation – an investigation that every member of the Judiciary Committee knows could end up before the Supreme Court. 2/ Regarding this Supreme Court vacancy: among the many consequential issues at stake, there is clearly a potential conflict of interest for President @realDonaldTrump. 1/ In Judiciary Hearing.   I will argue, among other things, that we should wait until after the election (McConnell rule) to hear and vote on a Supreme Court nominee.pic.twitter.com/u7jVi45y8p From low wages to short-termism, today’s corporations are keeping American workers from reaching their dreams.

But instead of trying to work with @SenateDems on any of the bills we’ve introduced to lower drug costs for Americans, Trump and @SenateGOP passed their tax bill which resulted in the 10 largest drug companies using their windfall to buy back stock, not to lower drug costs. Trump should also endorse my bill with @SenSanders & @SenBobCasey “The Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act” that would also lower costs by allowing safe importation of drugs from abroad. If Trump truly wants to lower prescription drug costs he should endorse our bill “Improving Access to Affordable Prescription Drugs Act” that allows Medicare price negotiation, ensures innovation in developing meds & discourages companies from spiking drug prices. Trump's announcement today on prescription drug costs is a talking point, not a plan. Trump won’t allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug costs.

Between mass shootings, the gunfire does not stop.   Between horrific national headlines, beneath even local news focus, we die.

Shahid lived below me in Brick Towers where I lived for 8 years.   His life mattered. His death must matter.
