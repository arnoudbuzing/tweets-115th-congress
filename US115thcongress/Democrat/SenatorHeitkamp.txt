Ahead of #LaborDay—a holiday that recognizes the history & challenges of working men & women in the US—I released my economic plan to reward hard work & fight for ND workers & their families throughout their  lives—from the beginning of their careers to retirement.

The inappropriate use of these waivers hurt ND farmers and biofuel producers, so I fought back. … I’ve also been fighting for a strong Renewable Fuel Standard. Urged Acting @EPA Director Wheeler to fulfill the administration’s commitment to a strong RFS & invited him to visit ND to see the impact of EPA policies on farmers, ranchers & energy producers. … WATCH: Last year w/ @SenWhitehouse @SenCapito & @SenJohnBarrasso I reintroduced the #FUTUREAct to extend 45Q tax credit to promote carbon capture while reducing emissions. It was signed into law this February, in a major victory for an all-of-the-above energy strategy.pic.twitter.com/NO1ghAJ4cJ Read more about the unique bipartisan coalition I successfully built for my #FUTUREAct which is now law to make sure we’re moving sensible energy policy forward for North Dakota in this @axios article from @AmyAHarder: … Today I’m talking about my work to create a viable path forward for coal & coal jobs. My #FUTUREAct becoming law is an important bipartisan victory & forges a path forward for ND's coal industry while reducing emissions. Read more in the @GFHerald … Women face poverty in retirement at rates drastically higher than men. No one should have to worry about losing retirement savings or falling into poverty in their golden years—our bill would help more ND women enjoy the long-term retirement security they’ve earned. In 2014, median retirement income for women was just 55% of the avg male retirement income. Also, women 65+ are 80% more likely to fall into poverty during retirement & are more likely to leave the workforce during their income-earning years to become caregivers for loved ones. Too often, women face challenges in the workplace w/ gender pay disparities & lack of access to paid leave to care for family members or newborns. Proud to help intro a bill to extend critical protections for women’s retirement security to help women better prepare for retirementpic.twitter.com/oZGwUIwt2I In August, I helped kick off the new @XcelEnergyND Foxtail Wind Farm project near Ellendale—projects like this one show the continued growth of wind energy & jobs in ND.

I’m proud of this achievement on behalf of ND’s energy industry & hard-working Americans. Now we’re seeing the results for ND. Here’s how it happened: … This @nytimes article chronicles my long, persistent efforts w/ @lisamurkowski to lift the 40 yr old ban on crude oil exports, which we succeeded in doing in 2015. Read more: … Earlier this year, US oil exports reached record levels—I’m looking back at why it’s happening: 3 yrs ago Congress lifted the ban on exporting oil, which I worked on for 1.5 yrs to build support, reach a deal & get votes to pass it. Read more in @gfherald … .@EIAgov reports that crude oil was the largest US petroleum export in the 1st half of 2018—in large part b/c of my work to successfully negotiate a bipartisan deal in 2015 to lift the ban on exporting oil. Follow along today to see what made it possible.  … I’ll keep pushing for solutions & action to end to this trade war and for smart trade policies that hold China accountable while also protecting markets for North Dakota goods. North Dakota commodities affected by this round of retaliatory tariffs from China include:  Beef—ND ranchers held nearly 1 million beef cattle at the start of 2018  Wheat—$2.76 billion in 2017  Dry Edible Beans—$301 million in 2017  Peas & Lentils—$151.3 million in 2017 The trade war is already hurting farmers & ranchers by causing commodity prices to fall & orders to be cancelled. Not a single order for North Dakota soybeans has been placed by China, which was the biggest customer of the our state’s crop—a value of $2.13 billion in 2017. After the administration escalated its #tradewar w/ China today, China imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that are vital to ND’s agriculture economy—at the worst possible time for ND farmers.pic.twitter.com/C9D9vxQTPV Last week I helped pass a bipartisan funding bill that includes funds to connect expectant mothers in rural areas to facilities w/ OB care & met w/ health care advocates in Grand Forks to examine rising U.S. maternal mortality rates.

Read more: … ND farmers & ranchers succeed when the fed. gov’t works to open export markets for their products & invests in relationships w/ our trade partners. Instead, @AgweekMagazine shows how the administration’s #tradewar is cutting off access to those markets, hurting our ag producers. … On Friday, new fraud protections for consumers went into effect that my #Relief4MainStreet bill—now signed into law—made possible.

This important @nytimes article highlights the need to support rural health care so mothers can have safe & health pregnancies … The US is the only industrialized country in the world w/ rising maternal mortality rates which grew 250% in 1987-2014. Read more in @ProPublica abt my bipartisan bill w/ @SenCapito to strengthen resources to address this growing crisis … This heartbreaking story series from @NPR shares the full picture of the growing maternal mortality rate health crisis & how urgent it is for Congress to take action by passing my bipartisan bill to address maternal health. … The crisis of rising maternal mortality rates in the US urgently needs more resources to understand how to address it effectively. This story in @USATODAY outlines how much work there is to do across the US to make sure mothers get the support they need … I’ll keep working to get our bill across the finish line, so we can prevent these heartbreaking tragedies & protect the next generation of mothers & infants. Follow the thread for resources to learn more about this crisis & why Congress must act  Earlier this week, I also helped pass a bipartisan funding bill that includes wins I secured: $50m in funding for a new initiative aimed at reducing maternal mortality. The bill also includes $12 million for expanded data collection at State Maternal Mortality review boards. My bipartisan bill would help facilitate stronger, safer, & healthier pregnancies by investing in cutting-edge research, beefing up information sharing, & giving physicians & providers the tools they need to improve the patient experience. According to @CDCgov, pregnancy-related deaths in the US rose by 250% from 1987-2014. We need to figure out what’s going on, & that requires collecting data to identify the factors that are causing young mothers to experience life-threatening health issues. Today in Grand Forks I brought together health care providers, families & maternal health advocates to examine the causes of rising maternal mortality rates in the US & to discuss ideas—like my new bill to better support the health & well-being of mothers & newborn children in NDpic.twitter.com/HVprgIjnva Important @nytimes article about how the administration’s #tradewar could create a “new economic Cold War” between China and the US. ND farmers need smart trade policies that support them and enable them to export, not trade wars. … Read more on @Medium about how my #Relief4MainStreet bill strengthens many important consumer protections for seniors, veterans, servicemembers, & those vulnerable to or victims of identity theft. … Good credit is essential to everything from getting a small business loan, a home mortgage, or simply applying for a new credit card—& consumers have enough challenges without having to worry about criminals impacting their credit scores. If you’re a parent, you can also request free credit freezes & free credit monitoring for your children’s credit scores to protect them from identity theft. Learn more on the @FTC’s child identity fraud resource guide: … According to the @WSJ, nearly 250,000 North Dakota residents may have been affected by the @Equifax data breach a year ago. It’s important to take immediate steps, like freezing your credit file for free, to protect yourself against identity theft.  Freezing credit prevents activity that could impact your credit score, like fraudulent loans taken out by someone who has stolen your identity.

In frequent phone calls and meetings w/ @SecretarySonny, I always emphasize the importance of trade to North Dakota’s ag economy. ND farmers want markets, but as long as the administration continues its #tradewar we have to do everything we can to mitigate the impact. Earlier this month I urged @USDA @SecretarySonny to improve the aid package to farmers suffering from slumping commodity prices & an uncertain future for this season’s crop. On a call today, I continued to push him to make our farmers whole as the cost of the #tradewar mountspic.twitter.com/yrBamh5HbZ Soybeans are an important part of ND’s ag economy, but the administration’s #tradewar is pushing China to lower its reliance on soybeans & to buy from other countries—potentially removing the biggest buyer of US soybeans from the market. Read more @reuters … It’s also critical that we continue to increase the protections for Native women & look at expanding tribal authority where appropriate so that abusers can no longer escape punishment in Indian Country. #MMIW #NotInvisible For too long, crimes of domestic violence hid in the shadows. But there is still much work to do. Now, Congress must quickly pass a long-term extension of #VAWA to give victims of abuse the resources they need to seek justice & recover from the trauma they’ve endured. The Senate also passed a short-term extension of the Violence Against Women Act (#VAWA). Its reauthorization was the 1st bill I cosponsored & helped pass in 2013. Since serving as ND’s Attorney General I've kept fighting to end domestic violence & protect victims of these crimes.pic.twitter.com/9WS4fKSrgD It also includes an amendment I’m proud to have successfully incorporated that makes sure North Dakota doctors, nurses, & other health care professionals have the proper training to identify & get help for victims of sex trafficking—which builds off my #SOARAct I fought to include a pay raise for our troops and for vital funding to support important ND national security missions like modernizing @TeamMinot’s B-52s, upgrading our nuclear arsenal, & supporting #UAS development so our servicemembers are supported Today w/ a bipartisan majority, I helped pass a funding bill that supports our military, access to rural health care, & a good education for our children—& I fought to include several provisions to keep ND communities strong & safe.pic.twitter.com/uQwJQYWh1Y This week, the administration announced tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods—adding up to a 10% tax that American consumers & businesses will be paying on many products according to @politico. Read more: … To help address the mental health crisis in ND, last week I hosted my #SummitToStopSuicide in West Fargo to bring together leaders from across ND for a comprehensive discussion about preventing suicide. Read more about the Summit in @inforum: … The severe and traumatic stress too many Native children face has long-term repercussions, including higher rates of suicide, & we need to do everything we can to make sure every child in our country is safe. Our bipartisan bill is part of that solution. Too often, local & statewide suicide prevention programs do not fully meet the needs of Indian Country, particularly when it comes to addressing the mental health challenges caused by poverty, abuse, addiction, or lack of educational or employment opportunities on reservations. From @CDCgov, the suicide rate of American Indians & Alaska Natives was over 3.5x higher than other ethnic groups. To help address this crisis in ND & across the country I helped intro a bipartisan bill to require states to work w/ tribal communities on new prevention strategies.pic.twitter.com/Fik5wL5uqn Last month, I was honored to visit @319ABW #GlobalHawkBase w/ @SecAFOfficial Wilson & base leadership for an update on base operations & the #GlobalHawk mission providing essential intelligence, surveillance, & reconnaissance to combatant commanders across the globe.pic.twitter.com/xpz07HMMkM Happy 71st birthday to the @usairforce, an important partner in keeping ND strong & safe!

I’ll keep pushing for resources these caretakers need to support vulnerable kids. ND doesn’t have a statewide program to support them, but Kinship Navigator programs can make a huge difference for these caregivers. My #KinshipConnectionsAct would help fix that by helping family caregivers get resources to navigate the transition to taking care of a child. The @USCensusBureau says abt 2.5 million children live w/ these caregivers without either of their parents at home. In our meeting, many caregivers explained they weren’t aware of social services or resources available to them when they took over responsibility for these children Today in Fargo I met w/ grandparents who have adopted or are fostering their grandkids as a result of suicide, opioid abuse, & other circumstances that have left the children’s biological parents unable to care for them, an arrangement known as grandfamilies.pic.twitter.com/VEgSJexJsD Gorgeous weather near Grafton this week, where the barley & wheat harvest is in full swing!pic.twitter.com/vhIKCdyWny In June, I called on @SBAgov to analyze the impact of the administration’s trade policies on #smallbiz—policies that could deal a real blow to small businesses that depend on or support industries that rely on trade.

Over 116,000 U.S. servicemembers died from combat and disease and another 200,000 were wounded. #WW1Centennial This November 11th, countries around the world will mark 100 years since the end of the First World War. The size, scope & horrors of this war were so great, & its impact upon civilization so significant, it became known as The Great War, & The War To End All Wars. #WW1Centennial Throughout this year’s @NDStateFair, I’m honoring the sacrifices of North Dakotans who served in #WW1 during the #WW1Centennial by sharing stories of servicemembers from across ND who often made the ultimate sacrifice to keep us safe & left proud legacies across our state.pic.twitter.com/08b6OKlKeg Happening now!
