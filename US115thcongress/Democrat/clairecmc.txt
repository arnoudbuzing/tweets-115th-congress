Nicest surprise last week? Seeing one of my heroes and dear friends who has cared for thousands of children, building and growing a safe space for so many who needed it. How many people can say they improved the lives of so many vulnerable children?

Happy to help. #HandsOffOurCare … And this. Get the idea? Nerve. He sues to wipe out the protection then “goes to camera” to say he doesn’t mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful. … And this. … And this. … And this. … And this. … And this. … And this. … And this. … And this. … And this. … This. … Shocking...not. … If @HawleyMO wants to protect people like Sharon, he has to walk the walk...talk isn’t enough.

Make sure people in Missouri see this. @McCaskill4MO … Protecting people with pre existing conditions is a family affair. #HandsOffOurCare … One 2018 report found customers overpaid for prescription drugs at the pharmacy 23% of the time, so Claire introduced bipartisan legislation to fix it. This week, the Know The Lowest Price Act passed the Senate—a step in the right direction towards lowering costs for Missourians. I’m on it Brenda. #HandsOffOurCare … Josh Hawley’s lawsuit would strip away protections from 2.5 million Missourians with pre-existing conditions.

You in? Sign up now   Great to be there @SenatorNasheed ! … The subpoena excuse is close to the dog ate my homework. Totally bogus. Does the AG’s office expect people to believe that a private lawyer has more power than the Atty General? Embarrassing. That’s what happens when you don’t actually investigate. An investigation isn’t “they told us they didn’t do anything wrong” AG should have filed suit under 610.027 like the private lawyer who found this out today. Embarrassing that private atty has to do AG’s job. #ladders … Happy to help! Now you can pull your rabbit out of your hat without a dumb federal regulation getting in your way! … Totally bogus excuse that he couldn’t subpoena. He could have done exactly what this private attorney did and gotten the information he claims he couldn’t get. That statute SPECIFICALLY gives the Attorney General the right to bring suit but he refused and this private citizen is doing his job for him. Not good.
