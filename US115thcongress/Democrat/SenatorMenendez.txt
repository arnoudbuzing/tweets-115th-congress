#DidYouKnow 1.       Refugees are the most vetted category of any traveler to our country? 2.       Refugee resettlement is a long-standing BIPARTISAN tradition 3.       Refugees return more in taxes than they receive in benefits & invigorate towns with new energy & businesses … Thank you to @SenatorMenendez and @MikeCrapo for introducing this resolution and making #prostatecancer a national priority. Early detection of this terrible disease is VITAL!   #PCAM18 The son of immigrants forced to flee Cuba - I became a US Senator A refugee forced to flee communism - @madeleine Albright became US Secretary of State America gave our families hope.

Nicolas Maduro’s criminal regime has turned Venezuela into a failed state with implications across the region. Proud to be joined by many colleagues in introducing the Venezuela Humanitarian Relief, Reconstruction, and Rule of Law Act of 2018 #SOSVenezuela … Esta propuesta atenderá la creciente catástrofe humanitaria de Venezuela, ampliando las sanciones para su círculo de secuaces y funcionarios que se enriquecen con fondos del Estado y el narcotráfico. #SOSVenezuela … .@NicolasMaduro ha convertido a Venezuela en un estado fallido, amenazando a toda la región, es por eso que junto a @MarcoRubio @SenBillNelson y otros Senadores presentamos el Proyecto de Ley para Alivio Humanitario de Venezuela, Reconstrucción, y Estado de Derecho de 2018.

The courage Deborah Ramirez and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford have shown is remarkable. Their treatment by Republicans and right wing pundits is despicable. These brave women deserve an FBI investigation, a pause on the nomination process, and basic respect. 3/3 A grateful Nation keeps its promises to those who serve and those who gave the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedoms. I will always work to ensure those commitments are met. 2/3 I've also dedicated myself to passing the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act to ensure any Vietnam vet exposed to Agent Orange receives the care they need, and even with the Trump administration putting up roadblocks, I'm still dedicated to making sure this bill becomes law 1/3 Proud to be with so many of NJ's bravest at the #RockTheVets celebration in Fair Lawn!

Never in my life did I imagine a President who would display such callous disregard, disrespect & outright contempt for 3.5 million Americans We don’t expect the President to be able to stop a storm, But when millions are in grave danger, a capable President would have had a three-star general deployed, had medical evacuation vessels, aid and relief delivery systems on standby, and the USNS Comfort ready for deployment We knew one year ago that Hurricane Maria would be dire.   But we had no way of knowing that the pain and suffering unleashed by a natural disaster named Maria would be prolonged by a man-made disaster named Trump. … The #DACA program is beneficial to Dreamers and to our economy. Before the Trump Administration ended the program last year, it contributed $42 billion to our economy.  Facts: … Despite the Trump Administration ending #DACA just over a year ago, DACA renewals are still being accepted. If you have DACA seek advice on eligibility to renew immediately. #DACARenewals 4. For decades, refugee resettlement was a bipartisan point of pride. I call on Republicans to join us in demanding the reversal of this decision, and put forth refugee policies that not only reflect our fundamental values, but also serve our humanitarian & strategic interests. 3. As Seasoned & qualified civil servants are being pushed out by anti-immigration hardliners, I’m concerned that Secretary Pompeo has either been unwilling or unable to be voice of reason in the room when the President has grinded the refugee program to a halt. 2. This jeopardizes our moral leadership on the global stage, and eliminates the critical role our refugee resettlement program plays in global stability. This is a time to defend our values and ideals as Americans, and alleviate the biggest refugee crisis since World War II. 1. Truly repugnant to see the Trump Administration double down on rejecting our foundational values & drastically decrease the number of refugees we accept. This rejects our humanitarian duty of providing those escaping persecution the opportunity to seek protection & safe haven I wish all those who are celebrating a meaningful and easy fast, and a blessed #YomKippur. From my family to yours, Gmar chatimah tovah! Happy Birthday @rudouglass!

Their program worked so well, that we fought to make it part of this legislation to combat the #OpioidCrisis. So proud it was included in today’s bill.pic.twitter.com/j0PP5PgkQo We have to make researching the opioid epidemic as easy as possible. Glad my bill to create annual reports about opioid issues in Medicaid made it into the Senate bill so third party researchers can use it to help end the epidemicpic.twitter.com/WYiaMPKcEX The rules regulating treatment facilities are often arbitrary and ridiculous. I wrote sections of the bill to remove unnecessary barriers to treatment and expand the number of facilities that can provide treatment for opioid misuse.pic.twitter.com/SoYnOUgu4G I wrote three different bills that were incorporated in the Opioid Crisis Response Act so that best efforts can be made to keep children out of foster care and with their families if a parent seeks treatment.pic.twitter.com/biZQ9WkqjD THREAD: Proud to have authored provisions to the Opioid Crisis Response Act that will keep children out of foster care, expand treatment opportunities, fight trafficking, expand the drug Court program, support opioid alternatives, and more. Here are the details SUCCESS! We have blocked Senator Lee’s proposed amendment and passed the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act. Patients should be able to learn how to get medicine for the lowest price - that's just one way to lower prescription drug costs. Here's others I'm working on pic.twitter.com/3hSGVNeDBw UPDATE -Sen Mike Lee is attempting to amend our Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act to limit the gag order ban to only *some* health plans. We just want to tell people their medicine could be cheaper! What's the problem? I urge my colleagues to join me & vote down his amendment Heading to the @DSenFloor to vote for the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, which simply lets pharmacists tell you if there's a cheaper way to buy prescription drugs.

By trying to kill the federal commitment to Gateway, Trump puts the safety of millions of commuters, and our economy, at enormous risk. I'll keep fighting for Gateway until the President stops playing politics with our infrastructure … It's amazing, but on #ConstitutionDay, we need to call on President Trump to read, follow & respect the Constitution. Trump ignores the tenants of democracy every day, risking everything we value. I think Sec. @HillaryClinton explains it best here: … The Senate unanimously passed the Know the Lowest Price Act to stop pharmacist gag orders for Medicare two weeks ago. This bill would simply expand the ban on gag orders to cover patients with ACA coverage. I've fought for both bills and will work to pass this tonight. The Senate has an important task tonight. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Patient Right to Know Act. Pharmacists shouldn't be banned from telling you how to save money on prescription drugs - that's common sense.pic.twitter.com/IgvSpTIf7r Now, I recognize the bill isn't enough. I fully support a larger, comprehensive bill to tackle this crisis. I’m disappointed Republicans let political concerns ahead of an election stop them from working w/ @SenateDems to do something truly groundbreaking. … As I head back to the senate tonight, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the Opioid Response Act so we can begin to crawl out of this #opioidcrisis. I've been trying to pass several bills to tackle the #OpioidEpidemic, so I'm proud many of my proposals are included. This is exactly why we can’t rush nominations. How can we vote on Kavanaugh when disturbing, credible allegations of sexual assault have been made? Even Republican Senators Jeff Flake & Bob Corker want to delay the vote. I agree. #DelayTheVote. … Pres Trump may use his bully pulpit to berate Hispanics, and kick Puerto Ricans while they're down, but at the #PuertoRicanDayParade, we see the monumental impact these NJans have on our state.

I visited after #HurricaneMaria to assess the damage, I fought for serious investments to rebuild, urged airlines to help victims, fought for health & housing assistance & more. Scroll to read the list  … Noteworthy on Trump’s Puerto Rico tweets: he’s essentially saying Puerto Ricans tried to game the system -  saying they included anyone who died "for any reason, like old age."  This simply reflects his most insidious views about Hispanics. #StandWithPuertoRico No hay nada más trágico que haya pérdidas humanas por la ineficiencia de un gobierno. De una forma abierta y descarada, el Presidente Trump juega con el dolor de nuestros compatriotas de Puerto Rico y los sigue menospreciando. … You’re right, Mr. President. The Hurricane didn’t kill 3,000 people. Your botched response did. … Main reason I just voted against Trump IRS Commissioner: he wouldn't defend NJ's charitable deduction tax credit program. The Trump Admin is so intent on sticking it to NJ that they’re willing to jeopardize longstanding programs in 32 other states, and Rettig is ok with it.pic.twitter.com/6SH52BZZTV So I can’t in good conscience support Charles Rettig. He won’t respect perfectly legal state-based programs that offer tax credits in return for contributions to nonprofits that do critical work in their communities. He’ll rubber stamp Trump’s politically motivated tax policies. We've always worked to ensure Americans don’t pay taxes twice on their hard-earned money - that is, until Donald Trump came along. Republicans abandoned their so-called fiscal conservatism, and passed a #GOPTaxScam that subjects hundreds of thousands of NJans to double taxation.pic.twitter.com/elNp7Ero88 Voting against President Trump’s nominee for IRS Commissioner, Charles Rettig. He won’t protect New Jersey’s middle class from higher property tax bills. He’ll be nothing more than a Republican rubber stamp for President Trump’s politically motivated tax policies. About to speak on @DSenFloor about Trump nominee for IRS Commissioner, and why I think he's bad for NJ and bad for our country.  … We need federal investments to save lives and reduce health disparities.

Helping Americans prepare for storms like #HurricaneFlorence, or detaining children and separating families?  Looks like the Trump Admin is focused on family separation...Irresponsible doesn't begin to describe it. … Wow - some "incredible, unsung success" story.  So not only did the Trump Administration know that at least 2,431 Americans had died in #HurricaneMaria in Puerto Rico, but they denied funeral assistance for those in need, and continued to act like everything was fine. … In Hoboken last night to remember those who lost their lives on #September11 and thank those who gathered here in the aftermath to give blood, bring food to firehouses, or console each other.

When a South Carolina law that could have blocked 63,756 minority voters from the polls came before Judge Kavanaugh, he thought it was constitutional. 2/5.

The bottom line is that with new technology comes new responsibility. We cannot let innovation render our background check system or federal gun safety laws obsolete. #StopDownloadableGuns For those naively saying there's no reason for concern about 3D printed guns because 3D printers are expensive - well, 3D printers once weighed hundreds of pounds & cost thousands, but today you can put one on your desk for less than 1k, and they're only getting cheaper. These so-called “ghost guns” are as terrifying as they sound. They can pass through metal detectors undetected. They have no serial numbers, so law enforcement can’t trace them. And anyone can buy a 3D printer and make themselves a firearm with no background check at all. … Trump logic - create a crisis, dig in, make it worse, backtrack, then offload the work of fixing it to nonprofits.

Today’s decision goes against fundamental American values, and by further damaging our reputation overseas, hurts the national security of the United States. #NoMuslimBanEver The Supreme Court today upheld a discriminatory policy that does not comport with our American values.

Su orden no nos dice nada acerca de los miles de niños que ya han sido separados de sus padres.  … NEWSFLASH:  The answer to locking kids in cages isn't to lock them up indefinitely with their parents.   Original policy: zero tolerance.  Trump’s new policy: still zero tolerance.  It's time to end zero tolerance, and stop criminalizing asylum seekers. We did it!  We put kids first and blocked Trump Republicans from cutting billions from the Children’s Health Insurance Program.    I know the news & polarized politics can make governing seem hopeless. But if we stand strong – if we don’t give in – we can still make a difference. … President Trump is lying to the American people.  He is lying.  The criminalizing of asylum seekers is in fact a newly-unveiled policy.  And a policy of persecuting families fleeing for their lives comes straight from the white nationalist fringe. … Today we celebrate the destruction of institutionalized slavery in the US, and while we have a long way to go in the march towards racial justice, #Juneteenth reminds us that we're capable of tremendous change if we dedicate ourselves to what's right. … They say a picture is worth a thousand words.

Sessions’ latest policy change is rooted in nativism and turns a blind eye to violence and abuse. … Jeff Sessions is telling women fleeing domestic violence to go back & work it out. He’s telling LGBTQ people who could be killed to suck it up. He’s saying he knows it’s a matter of life and death - but he just doesn’t care.  Risking lives to feed Sessions' nativism is disgusting … .@SenatorMenendez, during a  @ThisWeekABC appearance on Sunday, explained what's at stake and rebuked comments by a colleague that military force could be necessary after the #SingaporeSummit concludes. Watch what he had to say with @GStephanopoulos:  Only in the Trump era would forcibly tearing children away from their parents be considered an acceptable policy to uphold our values. This is shameful & un-American.  Read about our bill to #EndFamilySeparation (w/ @SenFeinstein @CoryBooker & @SenateDems) … At a time when so much of our focus is on what’s wrong with health care, it was great to celebrate what’s right with it at @MetropolitanFHN today.  I'll always fight for NJ's Community Health Centers to get the funding they deservepic.twitter.com/6mJNWNoU1u I go to IHOP so often, I thought the b could stand for Bob.   But with the International House of Burgers news, I've just got one question - at @IHOb, can I still get my usual three eggs over easy, corned-beef hash, and dry rye toast in the morning? … As Pres. Trump’s summit with Kim Jong Un approaches, @SenatorMenendez says he’s concerned “the president thinks that this is a mano-a-mano engagement in which he can achieve the success that we want."  "A meeting...and a deal is not the hardest part. It’s getting the right deal.”pic.twitter.com/7zzZgYIgbI As the President arrives in Singapore, I’ll be on @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos talking about what the President needs to get out of this North Korea summit. Tune in soon. A group of Senate Democrats is making key demands for a potential deal with North Korea – @GStephanopoulos goes one-on-one with a leader of the effort, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee @SenatorMenendez, this morning on "This Week"  Insulting and alienating our allies while praising our adversaries will ultimately hurt American workers, families, and national security. … Sólo en la era de Trump se puede considerar que este tipo de política es aceptable y semejante a nuestros valores como una nación de inmigrantes. Esta práctica es vergonzosa y antiestadounidense, y debe parar de inmediato. #EndFamilySeparation -->  …pic.twitter.com/iJQkEJ90yb Only in the Trump era would forcibly tearing children away from their parents be considered an acceptable policy to uphold our values.

This establishes a grant program for conservation projects to help save the North Atlantic right whale from extinction.pic.twitter.com/n1A9taSgC7 Hey GOP – this is what common-sense gun safety laws look like. … Private equity & real estate firms Bain, KKR, and Vornado loaded up Toys R Us with $5 billion in debt which hung like an albatross around Geoffrey the Giraffe's neck, and left 33,000 employees (1,600 in NJ!) with nothing. Kudos to @starledger for this. … More jaw-dropping than anything Pres. Trump tweets is his administration’s relentless effort to take away healthcare and jack up your premiums.  Simply put: this is a refusal to defend ppl w/ preexisting conditions, chronic conditions & children like the @LittleLobbyists … Raising the rent on nearly 300,000 low-income New Jerseyans — including 100,000 children — is absolutely despicable. … This law passed Congress and now millions of Americans with preexisting conditions can get health coverage without being charged higher premiums.    And THAT's what the Trump Admin is targeting? Not Rx drug costs, coverage gaps, or stabilizing the market?!  Unbelievable. … Incredibly sad about NJ native Anthony Bourdain’s suicide. He introduced us to global cultures, even bravely going to Azerbaijan despite being blacklisted.  No matter your race, gender or class, if you feel hopeless, know that things do get better. Please call 1-800-273-8255 We must prevent this administration from politicizing the #2020census with anti-immigrant sentiments & polluting the redistricting process to their benefit.  We must pass my bill to ensure #EveryoneCounts w/ @CoryBooker @maziehirono & many @SenateDems -->  …pic.twitter.com/lF4VyygXUY The Trump Administration's decision to add a citizenship question to the #2020Census is a dangerous, alarming & deeply political move opposed by experts, civil rights groups, six former Census Bureau Directors, 161+ Mayors, 19 State Attorneys General, & Members of Congress.pic.twitter.com/7Ad9nyQDJu Like I said, 2016 is the best investment Putin ever made. … Ambassador Grenell, in expressing his plans to “empower” conservatives throughout Europe, recklessly injected conservative politics into American foreign policy. This undermines Germans' trust in our Ambassador and, by extension, in the United States Government. … I assure you Mr. President, Kim Jong Un is preparing.  And if this is your attitude, then North Korea is celebrating already.   This should disturb everyone. … 2016 was the best investment Putin ever made.  He has been working for years to shatter and divide Europe for his own gain.  Now he has an American president doing it for him. … The evidence couldn’t be clearer – seat belts in school buses save lives. I'm working with @RepJohnFaso in the House and @SenatorMenendez in the Senate to introduce bipartisan legislation that takes the first step towards making sure our kids are as safe as they can be.pic.twitter.com/AhtL26qdsR Nearly 300,000 low-income New Jerseyans would be affected by this irresponsible plan.  Once again, this administration wants to make the most vulnerable citizens pay the price, while the top 1% get massive giveaways. … Meanwhile, China keeps granting trademarks to Trump and Ivanka Trump.   Who is our President negotiating for? The United States or the Trump Organization? The Trump #ChinaFirst policy strikes again. Cuts a deal with ZTE to save Chinese jobs and gets nothing for our economy or New Jersey. He’s tougher on Canada than he is on Chinese currency manipulation & billions of dollars of intellectual property theft. Makes you wonder why… … You can make it International House of Bowling if you want, so long as I can still get three eggs over easy, corned-beef hash, and dry rye toast.  Heck I go to @IHOP so often, the b’s gotta be for Bob. … .@SenatorMenendez is demanding answers from DHS regarding conditions in immigrant detention centers after being denied access.   #FamiliesBelongTogether Just intro'd legislation to make school buses safer, better protect students & assure parents that their kids will come home to them at the end of the day.  Great to work with @RepJoshG to ensure no family ever has to feel heartbreak being felt in #Paramus … Fighting to bring federal dollars to institutions like @RutgersU #CAIT is a top priority of mine so they can keep preparing the next generation of transportation professionals and developing new technologies for the future. #Rutgers #infrastructure #NewJersey … This #ImmigrantHeritageMonth I especially think of Dreamers –who despite their immigration status– recognize this country as their own and embody the values that have made America a nation of immigrants. We won't stop fighting for them until we #ProtectDreamers permanently. Los inmigrantes siempre serán una parte vital del Sueño Americano y seguiremos celebrando nuestras raíces a pesar de los ataques de una administración que no reconoce nuestros invaluables aportes la sociedad. #IHM2018 #ImmigrantHeritageMonth 4. The Trump Administration likes to forget that immigrants built our cities, invigorate our communities, and enrich our nation. #IStandWithImmigrants because I know they came here looking for a better life, and are dedicated to this country. #CelebrateImmigrants #IHM2018 3. So when the President demonizes immigrants as lazy or trouble-makers, I get so angry because my mom wasn't like that. I wasn't like that. My neighbors aren't. And I bet your grandparents and great grandparents weren't either. #ImmigrantHeritageMonth 2. I grew up in a tenement. I studied hard & fought for my classmates to be in school honors programs even if, like me, they couldn't afford the books. I was elected to the school board, Mayor, and now as a US Senator I fight to help NJ families realize their dreams & aspirations 1. This #ImmigrantHeritageMonth I want you to know my story. My parents fled a dictatorship looking for freedom & opportunity for their children. And they worked hard - my mom worked in a factory, making less money than the men despite doing the same work. She did it for us. Lamentables noticias desde Guatemala con más de 200 personas desaparecidas por la erupción del volcán de Fuego. Enviamos  nuestros pensamientos y plegarias a las familias afectadas. … No law requires separating children from their parents. It is purely a decision by the Trump Administration and they are choosing to tear families apart. Only in this Trumpian world could he suggest Democrats are to blame for what he's doing. … President Trump continues his attempt to slash…  … Wow. Whether you capitalize it or not Mr. President, that so-called “Wasteful Spending” includes $7 billion for the Children’s Health Insurance Program.   That’s not “wasteful spending” – that’s a moral obligation.pic.twitter.com/5QWyCaG3Oh Sen.

My letter with @SenatorMenendez @RepEspaillat to her outlines that ALL students have the right to a public education. Period. …  BREAKING  The Trump Admin. revised their budget rescission tweaks after criticism and STILL left in all the cuts to #CHIP!   Disgusting how hard the Trump Administration worked to make sure they could take  from children's healt … WAIT … haven't I said this before? … It wasn't just @SenJeffMerkley. @SenatorMenendez says his office was also barred from entering an immigration facility: 'This is outrageous. @SecNielsen owes us answers'. … Ludicrous to suggest @Eagles are abandoning their fans for refusing a photo-op with an offensive administration. They’re standing up for and with their fans who are people of color, immigrants, women, working class and everyone else this administration has beat down and attacked. … Secretary DeVos has a chance to correct her testimony so ALL children, regardless of immigration status, feel safe in school today.    But will she? @SenCortezMasto and I led 118 Members of Congress in calling on her to do just that.   …pic.twitter.com/StKgtVcH4i With skyrocketing healthcare premiums & prescription drug costs, we should be working together to improve access to affordable, quality healthcare  Instead, we have to fight our own govt from stripping the basic right to healthcare from our children. #CHIP … Getting a deal with North Korea is actually the easy part. The hard part is getting a good deal that actually works.   If the deal President Trump accepts doesn’t include full, verifiable denuclearization, it actually makes the world less safe. … Today @SenatorMenendez and I urged the Trump administration to do just that and to make sure any deal they reach with #NorthKorea meets five key principles: … After yrs of investigations, there’s no doubt prosecutor Nisman was murdered. I fully support Argentine authorities ensuring those responsible are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Iranian fingerprints on this terror underscore why we need a holistic Iran strategy … Esto es indignante e inaceptable. La Secretaria Nielsen tiene que responder. A mi equipo también le fue proihibida la entrada a un centro en donde separan a familias inmigrantes. … The Supreme Court #MasterpieceCakeshop ruling was disappointing. But it doesn't change existing law. No one should be refused service based on who you are, whom you love, or what you look like. Businesses should be #OpenToAll … This is outrageous. Sec. Nielsen owes us answers. My team was also barred from touring a migrant processing facility where families are being separated.    When the elected representatives of the people can't observe how our government is operating, we're in an upside down world. … The world we're in today has marriage equality, out service members, a pill to prevent HIV, and Modern Family. You built that world, and you're going to build one where conversion therapy is gone, trans kids feel safe in school, and federal laws protect LGBTQ workers! pic.twitter.com/KGp8dQEoR6 In Asbury Park to celebrate #PrideMonth w/ NJ's diverse #LGBTQ community.

How long can the Trump Administration tread the line between immigration policy enforcement and the violation of basic human rights? #FamiliesBelongTogetherpic.twitter.com/uc7HNyQgkw As this op-ed explains, “For our government to essentially hold immigrant children as hostages in exchange for the ‘ransom’ of their parents’ deportation is simply despicable.” #FamiliesBelongTogether   Read more here  … This story is heart-wrenching, harrowing, and absolutely unnecessary. Taking Mirian’s son from her did not make us safer.  It only traumatizes children. #FamiliesBelongTogether … The Trump Administration isn't making America great by forcing separation of parents from children and enforcing traumatic practices on families seeking asylum.

One thing we can't do: send thoughts & prayers and then go home. Republican inaction is unacceptable.pic.twitter.com/lAjvwe6QeA We should pass @SenBlumenthal bill to incentivize gun makers to make safer, smarter products by holding them liable  … I've also co-sponsored @SenFeinstein's Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act to ban "bump stocks" which were used in the deadly Las Vegas mass shooting. #DidYouKnow if a background check isn't completed in 3 days, a gun sale can go through without one? Another stupid loophole we could fix President Bill Clinton passed an assault weapons ban I voted for in 1993. President Bush let it expire.

Humbled to be recognized by Alliance Community Healthcare as a “healthcare hero” alongside @FrankPallone & @RepSires, but the real heroes are the patients and medical professionals who stood up to save Medicaid, protect gains for #NJFamilies & #SaveOurCare.
