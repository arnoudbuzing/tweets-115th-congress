The Land and Water Conservation Fund has invested more than $500 million in Montana’s public lands over the last 50 years—at no cost to taxpayers. We have 5 days left to #SaveLWCF and #KeepItPublic. #mtpol … A look at the packed house for today’s ‘State of the VA’ hearing from behind the dais.pic.twitter.com/Coa1RkZmys Senator Jon Tester weighs in with a horrible dad joke at the VA committee hearing.  The A/C isn't working so well, so he says:   "We don't want this to be a heated hearing." “Do any of you sell personal information? Yes or no?” That's what I asked tech execs at the @SenateCommerce hearing. The right to privacy is enshrined in our Constitution & we need to make sure it's protected—not just on paper, but online. Watch more here:  pic.twitter.com/EXhIqjkTti Have a crazy day here in the Senate! Kicked things off with Montana Coffee, a few interviews, and a whole mess of meetings. Just grilled top tech execs at the @SenateCommerce hearing on data collection & online privacy. Follow along with updates below! #mtpolpic.twitter.com/ySbmn75DBG @jontester is right. Why should companies get to sell/monetize information they don't think is private but I do? When @SenatorTester asks Amazon straight up if it sells yours data, Amazon is not able to give him a clear answer. Just what is Amazon doing with all that consumer behavior data, anyway? Senator Tester is “a farmer, not a technology guy” and does not understand why he keeps getting targeted ads for tires #dataprivacy I’ve been fighting since 2008 to bring Senate elections into the 21st Century & last week @POTUS finally signed my #EFile bill into law. This will require Senate candidates to file their finance disclosures online so folks can access them immediately. #TransparencyTuesday #mtpolpic.twitter.com/lEFd5Y5ZaN We must crack down on the dark money flooding our political system. That's why we’ve introduced legislation to overturn @USTreasury's decision to allow special interests to hide their donors from the IRS. #mtpol … On Wed. Sept. 26, @DeptVetAffairs Secretary Robert Wilkie will give a progress report on his first 60 days. @SenatorTester wants to hear what questions or comments veterans have for Secretary Wilkie.

A lot of this is made possible by the Land & Water Conservation Fund. If we don’t #SaveLWCF, which expires in 7 days, those 71k jobs & $7.1 billion will begin a countdown of their own. #KeepItPublic #mtpolpic.twitter.com/GntUsaZBgk If we want Montana to thrive we have to make sure Montanans can thrive. That's why, when it comes to drug abuse and addiction, we've got to figure out ways to help people get back on their feet. ​#mtpol … With the signing of my bipartisan e-file bill, the Senate is finally joining the 21st Century!

I was the first Senator to post my public schedule  & I still update it every day.  Check it out here:  Had a great discussion with @MFUfarmers about trade, tariffs & the #2018FarmBill last week. These issues are critical to our farmers & ranchers, which is why I have and will continue to fight for long-term certainty and stability in Montana's #1 industry. #mtpolpic.twitter.com/FxXpFtATt2 Since its creation in 1965, #LWCF has become one of the best tools we have to expand public access to our public lands. But funding for LWCF is set to expire in exactly 2 weeks. That’s why I’m demanding that Congress bring up a vote to reauthorize LWCF and #KeepItPublic #mtpolpic.twitter.com/qsqu01gPdE As a Montanan, I want to tell all the folks experiencing #HurricaneFlorence that we’re with you & as Ranking Member of the committee that funds @FEMA I will do everything I can to make sure you have what you need to stay safe and recover quickly. … Last month I joined my colleagues in condemning Secretary DeVos’ actions, which put the interests of predatory colleges over the interests of students and their families. Clearly, the court agreed. #mtpol … We know that struggling veterans who have access to @DeptVetAffairs resources are more likely to lead productive, healthy lives.

This bill will shine a light on Senate campaign contributions and make this vital information more quickly and easily accessible to the public. #mtpol … Health care costs are too high, especially prescription drug costs.

Here’s a question from Sandy in Craig. #mtpolpic.twitter.com/mo26tkX4kH I’ve already introduced a bill to protect small businesses against the crushing weight of paperwork & red tape required to collect sales tax on behalf of other states. Small businesses will be facing a crisis in October if Congress doesn’t act now. #mtpol … I hope you will all join me in celebrating National Health Center Week! Community health centers provide top-notch, affordable health care to more than 100k Montanans/year. That’s why I #valueCHCs & fought so hard to reauthorize funding for CHCs earlier this year. #NHCW18 #mtpolpic.twitter.com/h4fRmKwatL Today, @POTUS signed the 2019 #NDAA. This law strengthens the mission at Malmstrom, invests in the Montana Air National Guard, and provides the largest pay raise for our troops in nearly a decade. #mtpol … For 50+ years, @AmeriCorps volunteers have worked to protect Montana's public lands, strengthen our communities & help folks in need.

I'm opposing a plan that would require businesses selling products or services over the internet to collect sales tax. Montanans have voted against a sales tax not once, but twice. That's why I'm taking a stand against a nationwide online sales tax. #mtpol  … Today I took telecomms giants to task for refusing to provide rural areas with better internet & wireless coverage.

The Caring For Our Veterans Act is that cure. We believe this bill needs to be passed right away because Congress can’t keep governing with short term solutions.

This will all be at expense of our kids and grandkids, who will be paying for this $1.5 trillion bill long after we’re gone.  … This bill also destroys the foundation of our health care system: 13 million Americans will become uninsured and premiums will rise by 10%. And for folks above 65? This bill will force a $25 billion cut to Medicare. … The lion’s share of these tax breaks will go to the very wealthy & corporations. And by 2027, the middle-class will actually be paying more in taxes than they do now, while corporate tax breaks remain permanent. … 30 years ago, the Senate passed President Reagan’s tax reform bill 97-3—that could have been the case today, but there was no effort to build a bipartisan consensus around this bill. … Tonight, once again, Congress is proving to the American people that Washington is broken. The tax bill in front of us is the product of dysfunction, partisanship, and political desperation.

It's just commonsense.pic.twitter.com/GGCpktdrHk My bipartisan reg relief & reform bill will not only help community banks, rural families & small businesses thrive, but also implement stronger consumer protections that are particularly crucial in the wake of the recent @WellsFargo & @Equifax scandals.  pic.twitter.com/9P8s39cN3f Montana’s community banks and credit unions didn’t cause the financial crisis, but they’ve been strained under harsh rules written for Wall Street. Let’s ease the burden for our Main Street banks and credit unions and unleash more capital for small businesses. #mtpol … In the midst of profound partisanship, I’m proud to be one of the folks demonstrating that bipartisanship still exists in Congress. This bill makes small, commonsense changes to help community banks and Main Street businesses thrive. … To learn more about our bipartisan bill, click here:  … … Today in the Senate Banking Committee, we’re taking up our bipartisan bill to get Montana Main Street businesses the regulatory relief they need to succeed.

Washington dysfunction has hit a new low and Montana families and small businesses deserve better than this. I was just handed a 479-page tax bill a few hours before the vote. One page literally has hand scribbled policy changes on it that can’t be read. This is Washington, D.C. at its worst.

We need a bipartisan solution that prioritizes hard-working MTs, provides relief to small businesses & doesn’t saddle our kids w/ more crushing debt.pic.twitter.com/5Dd8b5Ilkj We just made some folks in Congress  by introducing an amendment to ensure this “tax reform” bill does NOT add $1 trillion to the debt. But it was killed on a party line vote because some folks in Congress are choosing to play politics at the expense of our kids and grandkids.pic.twitter.com/0eSf46Dn4J My amendment with @SenAngusKing will guarantee that the tax reform bill will not increase the deficit.  Proud to defend our kids and grandkids from more debt. #mtpol … As the Senate debates the tax reform bill, we must consider its impact on the debt.

It’s time Congress fix this issue once and for all, especially in rural states. Providing kids with health care is a no-brainer. #mtpol … Folks in Congress have allowed the Children’s Health Insurance Program to expire. CHIP provides care to 24,000+ kids across MT every year & if Congress doesn’t act soon, these kids could lose coverage by the beginning of next year.
